The method sets the task of exegesis within the literary context of first-century letters as well as the theological context of major themes present in Paul's letters. The book goes beyond exegesis to discuss strategies for communicating the central truthesof Paul's first-century messages to a twenty-first-century audience. Each chapter includes a list of helpful resources to the step of interpretation discussed. A glossary defining technical words and samples of moving from exegesis to proclamation make this guide practical and user-friendly. Designed as a handbook for seminary and graduate students, the book provides a go-to guide that will also serve seminary-trained pastors, upper-level college students, and well-motivated lay people. As readers work through this handbook, they will begin to see and interpret the narrative writings as Paul intended them to be understood.</p></p><p>"An admirable exegetical primer. . . It deals with the literary genre of Paul's canonical letters, the oral and historical backgrounds of each of them, together with such important critical issues as their rhetorical features, their epistolary conventions, and how to 'establish' the text by means of the principles of text criticism. . . . His treatment of these important matters is perceptive, his overall presentation is helpful, and the materials that he presents will be 'a good read' for many beginning theological students." (Richard N Longenecker, Emeritus Professor of New Testament <i>Wycliffe College, University of Toronto</i> 2012-12-01)<br><br>"It is rare to find in one book the full complement of skills needed to do exegesis, in this case exegesis of Pauline literature. As such, this work provides an invaluable resource for anyone committed to understanding the apostle Paul in his own words. I highly recommend it to Christian colleges and seminaries alike." (C. Marvin Pate, Chair of Christian Theology <i>Pruet School of Christian Studies, Ouachita Baptist Universtiy</i> 2012-12-01)<br><br>"John Harvey's teaching and writing consistently display two highly laudable characteristics: analytical skill and accessible scholarship. Harvey demonstrates that true biblical scholarship is not an end, but a means by which to further the purposes for which Scripture has been given: teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness. This book will serve as a significant resource to all who wish to understand the New Testament more fully and expound it more effectively." (Ralph E. Enlow, Jr., President <i>Association for Biblical Higher Education</i> 2012-12-01)</p><h2>Landscapes of Fear</h2><p><p><br>To be human is to experience fear, but what is it exactly that makes us fearful? <i>Landscapes of Fear</i>&#x2014;written immediately after his classic <i>Space and Place</i>&#x2014;is renowned geographer Yi-Fu Tuan&#x2019;s influential exploration of the spaces of fear and of how these landscapes shift during our lives and vary throughout history.</p><br><p>In a series of linked essays that journey broadly across place, time, and cultures, Tuan examines the diverse manifestations and causes of fear in individuals and societies: he describes the horror created by epidemic disease and supernatural visions of witches and ghosts; violence and fear in the country and the city; fears of drought, flood, famine, and disease; and the ways in which authorities devise landscapes of terror to instill fear and subservience in their own populations.</p><br><p>In this groundbreaking work&#x2014;now with a new preface by the author&#x2014;Yi-Fu Tuan reaches back into our prehistory to discover what is universal and what is particular in our inheritance of fear. Tuan emphasizes that human fear is a constant; it causes us to draw what he calls our &#x201c;circles of safety&#x201d; and at the same time acts as a foundational impetus behind curiosity, growth, and adventure.<br></p></p><p><p><br>Yi-Fu Tuan is the J. K. Wright and Vilas Professor Emeritus of Geography at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.<br></p>"An elegant encyclopedic treatise on anxiety and its various manifestations, down through the ages. Tuan is an interdisciplinary virtuoso, ranging effortlessly over history, psychology, and anthropology. An arresting and beautifully documented study." &#x2014;<i>Kirkus</i><br></p><h2>On Reading the Constitution</h2><p>Our Constitution speaks in general terms of &#x201c;liberty&#x201d; and &#x201c;property,&#x201d; of the &#x201c;privileges and immunities&#x201d; of citizens, and of the &#x201c;equal protection of the laws&#x201d;&#x2015;open-ended phrases that seem to invite readers to reflect in them their own visions and agendas. Yet, recognizing that the Constitution cannot be merely what its interpreters wish it to be, this volume&#x2019;s authors draw on literary and mathematical analogies to explore how the fundamental charter of American government should be construed today.</p><p><p>Laurence H.

Stevens Professor of Law at Cornell Law School.</p>&#x201c;A lively and important contribution to the continuing dialogue on constitutional interpretation... [The book] serves to remind us of the trouble we make for ourselves when we assume that we can predict the conclusions of the original intentionalist, that liberals are always activists and conservatives never, or that the protections of liberty afforded by a living Constitution have all come from only one ideological camp.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Harry N.

A note to the Editor Dear Henry, I have been Simon Feximal&#x2019;s companion, assistant and chronicler for twenty years now, and during that time my Casebooks of Feximal the Ghost-Hunter have spread the reputation of this most accomplished of ghost-hunters far and wide. You have asked me often for the tale of our first meeting, and how my association with Feximal came about. I have always declined, because it is a story too private to be truthfully recounted, and a memory too precious to be falsified. But none knows better than I that stories must be told. So here is it, Henry, a full and accurate account of how I met Simon Feximal, which I shall leave with my solicitor to pass to you after my death. I dare say it may not be quite what you expect.

Since its first publication in 1764, there have followed no less than forty editions. The proliferation of secondary literature further indicates that Reid's work is flourishing as never before. Yet Reid scholars have been acutely aware of proceeding without the full textual evidence. There exist thousands of unpublished manuscript pages in Reid's hand, many of which relate directly to the composition of <em>Inquiry</em>. Furthermore, no account has been taken of the successive alterations made to the four editions published in Reid's lifetime. The present edition, therefore, aims to present a complete, critically edited text of the <em>Inquiry</em>, accompanied by a judicious selection of manuscript evidence relating to its composition.</p><p>The volume contains an editor preface presenting the raison d'�tre for the edition followed by an introduction giving the central argument of the Inquiry by means of an historical and philosophical account of its formation; an account which also indicates the significance of the MSS contained in the section containing related documents. The critical text is based on the fourth life-time edition (1785), while the textual notes include bibliographical details and allusions, translations, references to secondary literature, and selected passages from Reid's MSS.</p></p><p><p>Derek R. Brookes is an independent scholar and the coeditor of <em>Thomas Reid: Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man</em> (Penn State, 2002).

His major work, <em>An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense</em>, was published in 1764, the year in which he accepted appointment as Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Glasgow.</p>&#x201c;In this critical edition of <i>An Inquiry Into the Human Mind</i>, Reid&#x2019;s classic eighteenth-century treatise in the philosophy of mind appears with supplementary manuscripts and correspondence that, along with a crack editing job, provide the context for a rich understanding of this work.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;Marc Baer, <i>Review of Metaphysics</i><br><br>&#x201c;This edition of the <i>Inquiry</i> . . . is a model of careful scholarship. . . .

His hymns have been widely published and he has compiled three hymnals. His most recent collection (with Russell Schulz-Widmar) is <i>Sing of the World Made New:&nbsp; Hymns of Justice, Peace, and Christian Responsibility</i>.</p><i>God's Good Earth</i> is a wonderful resource to celebrate the majesty, mystery and soul of Earth. The songs, praise and poetry of creation erupt and stir a spiritual presence both within us as worshippers and an awareness of that presence within the deep domains of Earth. A fantastic resource for celebrating The Season of Creation every Sunday in the year. `Where can Wisdom be Found?' In creation (Job 28.23-27)!Norman Habel, editor of the Earth Bible series in Australia, a sponsor of the Season of Creation, and author of works relating to ecology, worship and the Scriptures<br><br>These are powerful meditations at a moment when they're desperately needed-think of this book as a solar-charged battery to give you the strength to do the work that the planet desperately needs.Bill McKibben, Schumann Distinguished Scholar, Middlebury College<br><br>Rich, abundant, fertile, and creative-the Rowthorns have drawn from broad and deep seas of wisdom to move hearts and mountains in search of Creation's healing. Worship frames for a year of weeks explore the wonder of God's creation, creatures human and not, and the groaning of all. May these prayers and poems, hymns and scriptures, reflections and blessings work their wondrous transformation in all God's people, for tikkun olam, repair of the interconnected world God has made. Caveat lector, for you will weep, rejoice, be awed and humbled, and by grace, transformed.The Rt. Rev. Katharine Jefferts Schori, Assisting Bishop, San Diego, Formerly XXVI Presiding Bishop of The Episcopal Church<br><br>This is an unusually rich and coherent collection, bringing together reflection, praise and challenge in just the right measure. We have imaginative and alive texts that will powerfully reinforce the necessary sense of both promise and urgency that we must learn to bring to the question of our Christian relation with the environment. It will be a great gift to the churches.Rowan Williams, Master of Magdalene College in Cambridge, UK, and former Archbishop of Canterbury<br><br>"In the end we will conserve only what we love," affirmed Senegalese conservationist Baba Dioum. "We will love only what we understand, and we will understand only what we are taught." The liturgies developed by Anne and Jeffery Rowthorn's book provide fifty-two ways to understand and love God's good earth more deeply. Their work leads us from praise and thanks to lament and confession and finally to a renewed commitment to all creation and a new sense of wonder at God's infinite imagination in fashioning this world. The Rowthorns challenge us to pray, sing, and act for the earth. Most of all, they give us the words and worship we need to love this world as God loves it, for the sake of the earth and for generations yet to come. It should be required text for every seminary course on liturgy and the worship leaders of every congregation.Rev. Talitha Arnold, Senior Minister, The United Church of Santa Fe<br><br>In <i>God's Good Earth</i>, Anne and Jeffery Rowthorn have blessed the churches with a beautiful and timely gift. Representing a rich diversity of traditions and voices, these 52 liturgies invite us to worship the God of creation, ponder our deep communion with all living things, repent of our responsibility for environmental destruction and its devastating consequences for marginalized peoples, and reform our actions in agreement with God's hopeful vision for the renewal of the earth.Dr. Thomas John Hastings, Executive Director, Overseas Ministries Study Center, New Haven, Connecticut<br><br>If you have ever been overwhelmed by a panorama from a mountaintop or overcome with wonder at the power of the sea as it rushes against a shore, this book is for you. If you have become concerned about the rising temperatures of our oceans and shorelines and understand that there is a religious dimension to these issues, this book is for you. If the social injustices that accompany environmental degradation are moral concerns, this book is for you. This collection of texts from 28 books of the Bible, 42 other authors, 37 writers of hymns plus 90 supplementary hymns, arranged in 52 thematic liturgies, provides those seeking a means to express their faith in both formal and informal settings. I warmly recommend this book to all who understand environmental issues in religious terms.Gregory E. Sterling, The Reverend Henry L. Slack Dean, The Lillian Claus Professor of New Testament, Yale Divinity School<br><br>What a sublime gift this new collection of liturgies is. I have loved praying with these wide-ranging, distinctive, profoundly moving texts. Among the burgeoning resources for a creation-attuned spirituality, Anne and Jeffery Rowthorn's book stands out. <i>God's Good Earth</i> is compelling in its language, ecumenical and global in scope, richly diverse in the voices it sounds, authentically theological, and-simply-beautiful.

Dasent's translation of Asbjornsen and Moe's text, found in Marcia Brown's version (HBJ, 1957; o.p.). Instead there is language devoid of rhythm and mystery. In addition, unnecessary motivations are ascribed to the characters that serve to explain the reason for their violent actions (the troll is hungry; the big Billy Goat Gruff is angry). These explanations serve only to dilute the power of the story. The full-color illustrations are humorous; the goats walk about on their hind legs, the smallest goat wears a diaper and sucks a pacifier, and the biggest wears a black leather jacket, to reinforce the point that he is tough enough to destroy the troll. The troll is quite scary, and although he does have a nose as long as a poker, his eyes are not as big as saucers; the illustration that introduces the troll does not even show his eyes. A better purchase is Galdone's version (Clarion, 1981) which is well-suited for use with large groups and more closely follows the standard translation.

Wood presents a landmark collection of British and American pamphlets from the political debate that divided an empire and created a nation: </b>In 1764, in the wake of its triumph in the Seven Years War, Great Britain possessed the largest and most powerful empire the world had seen since the fall of Rome and its North American colonists were justly proud of their vital place within this global colossus. Just twelve short years later the empire was in tatters, and the thirteen colonies proclaimed themselves the free and independent United States of America. In between, there occurred an extraordinary contest of words between American and Britons, and among Americans themselves, which addressed all of the most fundamental issues of politics: the nature of power, liberty, representation, rights and constitutions, and sovereignty. This debate was carried on largely in pamphlets and from the more than a thousand published on both sides of the Atlantic during the period Gordon S. Wood has selected thirty-nine of the most interesting and important to reveal as never before how this momentous revolution unfolded. This second of two volumes follows the course of the ultimate crisis that led from the Boston Tea Party to the final break, as the focus of debate turns from questions of representation and rights to the crucial issue of sovereignty. Here is a young Thomas Jefferson offering his radical <i>Summary View of the Rights of British America;</i> Samuel Johnson pronouncing <i>Taxation no Tyranny</i> and asking "How is that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negros?"; Edmund Burke trying to hold the empire together in his famous <i>Speech on Conciliation</i>; and Thomas Paine turning the focus of American animus from Parliament to king in the truly revolutionary pamphlet <i>Common Sense</i>.

The first was Captain William Henry Irvine Shakespear, a political agent from the Government of India&#39;s Political Department. Born in October 1878 in India, Shakespear spent much of his childhood away from his Anglo-Indian parents, schooling in Portsmouth and later in the Isle of Man, before entering Sandhurst as a British Indian Army Officer Cadet. On his return to India, Shakespear spent six years in military service before he joined the Political Department in 1904, serving twice in Bandar Abbas and briefly in Muscat. Shakespear&#39;s next mission was as a political agent in Kuwait, arriving at the coastal Sheikhdom in the spring of 1909. For the next four years, he travelled extensively into the Nejdi desert, providing both London and Delhi with valuable intelligence about the vastly unknown interior as well as cultivating a personal relationship with Ibn Sa&#39;ud, the Emir of Riyadh. At a time when London and Constantinople were negotiating the Anglo-Ottoman treaty, Shakespear almost became persona non grata for advocating the need to back the emir after his tribal warriors had expelled the Ottoman garrisons in al-Hasa in 1913. When war was declared in July 1914, Shakespear was one of the first to try to join the British Army to fight in France, but when the Ottoman Empire looked set to ally with Germany, the powers that had previously shunned him now needed his unique knowledge of Central Arabia and relationship with Ibn Sa&#39;ud. That October, as many of his peers and countrymen crossed the English Channel to reinforce those already in the trenches, Shakespear set sail for Kuwait on special duty to rendezvous with the emir. It was a mission that T E Lawrence would later commend, acknowledging the crucial role that the political agent played during the early stages the Middle Eastern theatre of war. Shakespear was a pioneer in exploring the Nejd, capturing many firsts with his camera, although there were a few other equally intrepid British officials who preceded him into the desert. From the late-18th century, the East India Company collided numerous times with the House of Sa&#39;ud as both attempted to understand the intentions of the other, before the political agent finally laid the foundations for formal diplomatic relations with Ibn Sa&#39;ud, and later with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In 1988 aged 18, Alan Dillon left his hometown of Watford and joined the Royal Marines. After twelve years of overseas travel, operational tours and a short spell of learning Arabic, he abandoned the profession of soldiery for one of diplomacy, joining the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 2000. He has served in Afghanistan, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia and Oman, interspersed by spells in various parts of Whitehall, mostly covering the Gulf region. The book is a result of three years&#x2019; research on political agent Captain Shakespear.</p><h2>Lives of Christopher Chant (The Chrestomanci Series)</h2><p>His father and uncles are enchanters, his mother a powerful sorceress, yet nothing seems magical about Christopher Chant except his dreams.

Then there was the ch�teau itself: a sprawling palace once the residence of kings, its grounds the perfect place to play hide-and-seek. The curiosities of the small town and the time with his family as expats left such an impression on him that thirty years later Carhart returned to France with his wife to raise their two children. Touring Fontainebleau again as an adult, he began to appreciate its influence on French style, taste, art, and architecture. Each trip to Fontainebleau introduces him to entirely new aspects of the ch�teau's history, enriching his memories and leading him to Patrick Ponsot, the head of the ch�teau&#x2019;s restoration, who becomes Carhart&#x2019;s guide to the hidden Fontainebleau. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What emerges is an intimate chronicle of a time and place few have experienced. In warm, precise prose, Carhart reconstructs the wonders of his childhood as an American in postwar France, attending French schools with his brothers and sisters. His firsthand account brings to life nothing less than France in the 1950s, from the parks and museums of Paris to the rigors of French schooling to the vast ch�teau of Fontainebleau and its village, built, piece by piece, over many centuries. <i>Finding Fontainebleau</i> is for those captivated by the French way of life, for armchair travelers, and for anyone who has ever fallen in love with a place they want to visit over and over again.</p><p>The son of an air force officer, <b>Thad Carhart</b> grew up in a variety of places, including Washington, D.C.; Fontainebleau, France; Minneapolis; Amherst, Massachusetts; and Tokyo. After graduating from Yale, he worked for the State Department as an interpreter. His first book,&nbsp;<i>The Piano Shop on the Left Bank</i>, appeared in 2000, published by Random House.&nbsp;<i>Across the Endless River</i>, a historical novel, came out in 2009 with Doubleday. He lives in Paris."While bringing alive this redolent Gallic chapter of his boyhood (baguettes from the boulangerie; inkwells and laborious handwriting exercises at school), Mr. Carhart also resurrects the mood and mores of a particular window in time: the 1950s of Ike and Elvis&#x2019;s America, and postwar France. . . .

Due to Japan&#x2019;s war time General Mobilization Law, many boys of about 14 years of age who had graduated from the national higher elementary school system (for 13-14 years olds) were drafted into maritime service. The peak of this draft was in 1944. These boys were put into training schools to become seamen and after only 3 months of training were sent unarmed into the theater of war at sea. It is said that the number of boys who were trained was about 40,000 and that, of those who died aboard ship, 987 were 14 years old, 2,866 15 years old, 3,187 16 years old, 3,967 17 years old, and 4,204 18 years old &#x2013; a part of history of which very few people are aware.

Following a series of incidents between American settlers and the Native tribes, the Earl of Dunmore led one militia army, with Colonel Andrew Lewis leading another, against the Shawnees and Mingos. On October 10, 1774, a force of about 700 Indians attacked Lewis's 1,100-man army at what is now Point Pleasant, West Virginia. Lewis's men succeeded in driving the Indian forces off, though only after suffering about 20 percent casualties. The two Virginia militia forces pursued the Indians into Ohio before a peace treaty was signed that opened up Kentucky for American settlement.</p></p><p><p>John F.

In fact, it is only the best-known recent experiment in a long line of similar efforts going back to the 1970s. But the story behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and its blockchain technology has largely been untold&#x2015;until now. In <i>Digital Cash</i>, Finn Brunton reveals how technological utopians and political radicals created experimental money to bring about their visions of the future: protecting privacy or bringing down governments, preparing for apocalypse or launching a civilization of innovation and abundance that would make its creators immortal.</p><p>The incredible story of the pioneers of cryptocurrency takes us from autonomous zones on the high seas to the world&#x2019;s most valuable dump, from bank runs to idea coupons, from time travelers in a San Francisco bar to the pattern securing every twenty-dollar bill, and from marketplaces for dangerous secrets to a tank of frozen heads awaiting revival in the far future. Along the way, <i>Digital Cash</i> explores the hard questions and challenges that these innovators faced: How do we learn to trust and use different kinds of money? What makes digital objects valuable? How does currency prove itself as real to us? What would it take to make a digital equivalent to cash, something that could be created but not forged, exchanged but not copied, and which reveals nothing about its users?</p><p>Filled with marvelous characters, stories, and ideas, <i>Digital Cash</i> is an engaging and accessible account of the strange origins and remarkable technologies behind today&#x2019;s cryptocurrency explosion.</p></p><p>This book traces the history of digital money from the initial idea for criyptocurrencies in the 1970s to Bitcoin and the current hysteria over digital cash.<b>Finn Brunton</b> is assistant professor in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communication at New York University.

The authors of these canonical works were bishops and priests who usually wrote to guide clergy in addressing issues arising from diocesan and parish life. Unlike any of these other guides, in the present work an entire church subject to Islamic persecution sought the counsel of its sole Eastern sister church that was free from Muslim conquest. This pastoral guide for a church under Islam sets forth a pattern meant for a patriarchate to apply in addressing issues arising in a society under the domination of an alien religion that regarded itself as superior by nature.<br> &nbsp;<br> In addition to the main issue, the twelfth-century document has a number of interesting features relevant for Church history, including its record of ancient Christian practices regarding liturgy, fasting, preparation for the Eucharist, burial of the dead, deaconesses, and the internal life of Arabic Christians living in what would become modern Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria. The translation as well as its annotations and introductory history represent a time capsule of the Church's history in the aftermath of the Muslim conquests of the Middle East and just before the taking of Constantinople in 1204 by the Latin Crusaders.</p><p>The Rev.

It includes extensive use of natural heat flow methods and the arrangement of building materials to direct heat from wherever you get it to wherever you want it, all without using machinery to make it work. With the rising cost of energy, all home builders should become familiar with basic PAHS principles.</p><p> The goal of Passive Annual Heat Storage is to provide a method of placing building materials and organizing construction so the comfortable environments produced are continuously pleasant. The resulting subterranean home interiors are balanced with the natural environment and are able to extract all of their energy needs from their surroundings without using any commercial energy sources. Thus, there is no longer any need for using mechanical devices or causing any disruption in global ecosystems.</p><p> Build a home that naturally stays warm in the winter and cool in the summer!</p></p><p>John Hait began inventing at the age of ten, when he obtained his first Amateur Radio License.

She bit the inside of her cheek to hold back a smile as she patted her leg. &#x201c;Sillikin, come.&#x201d;</p><p>The small black and tan dog cocked its head, then trotted over, as if expecting a reward for a job well done. Kitty wasn&#x2019;t sure why Sillikin sometimes stared at people, but it seemed to be in disapproval, and her mother-in-law sensed that.</p><p>What secret sins could lurk in the soul of straight-backed, gray-haired Lady Cateril? She was the sort of woman often described as beyond reproach. These days, dressed permanently in mourning black, she had been canonized by the heroism and death of her younger son&#x2014;Kitty&#x2019;s husband, Marcus.</p><p>Had Sillikin caught Lady Cateril wishing that the heroism and death had come together? That Marcus hadn&#x2019;t lived, wounded and broken, for seven more years and married someone like Kitty? That devotion to Marcus&#x2019;s memory hadn&#x2019;t required her to offer Kitty a home? Kitty and her irritating dog.</p><p>&#x201c;I will say again, Kathryn, that you should rename that creature.&#x201d;</p><p>And I will say again, Kitty supplied silently, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s too used to the name by now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a dumb creature. She cannot care.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then why do dogs respond to their names as people do, Mama?&#x201d;</p><p>Names. So powerful and so often poorly considered. Six years ago, she&#x2019;d named a wriggling ball of fluff Sillikin. Three years before that, when Kitty had married Marcus, she&#x2019;d called his mother Mama, in the hope of pleasing the disapproving woman. It had never seemed possible to change to something more formal.</p><p>Her bid for approval had been a hopeless cause. Lady Cateril&#x2019;s favorite son, the wounded hero of Roleia, bound to a seventeen-year-old chit? Had she hoped that by using the name Kathryn, the chit would become a sober matron? &#x201c;Kitty,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said at first meeting, &#x201c;is a romping sort of name.&#x201d; There&#x2019;d been a clear implication that Kitty was a romping sort of person.</p><p>Better that than being starchy as a frosted petticoat on a winter washing line!</p><p>The weather today wouldn&#x2019;t freeze cotton as stiff as a board, but it was raining. That trapped Kitty in the house, and effectively in this small parlor that smelled of wood smoke and the mustiness that came from long-closed windows. The larger, airier drawing room was rarely used in the colder months, so the fire there was unlit.</p><p>She would have liked to retreat to her bedroom even though that, too, lacked a fire, but in Lady Cateril&#x2019;s domain, bedrooms were not sitting rooms. They weren&#x2019;t dining rooms, either. The only time anyone was served food in her bedroom was if she was ill.</p><p>Kitty knew she should be grateful to be housed there. Her only other option was to live in cheap lodgings somewhere. At least there she had everything she needed and the estate to walk about on.</p><p>She had everything except freedom.</p><p>In the beginning, she&#x2019;d rubbed along well enough with her mother-in-law, united in grief. However, when six months had passed, Kitty had followed custom and prepared to put off her widow&#x2019;s weeds. When Lady Cateril realized Kitty had ordered new gowns in gray, fawn, and violet, she&#x2019;d reacted as if she&#x2019;d spat on Marcus&#x2019;s grave. When reproaches and then tears hadn&#x2019;t changed Kitty&#x2019;s intent, Lady Cateril had taken to her bed and sent for the doctor. Kitty had been badly shaken, but the rest of the family hadn&#x2019;t seemed alarmed, so she&#x2019;d stuck to her guns. The first gown had arrived, a very plain gray wool round gown, and she&#x2019;d worn it, quaking. The next day Lady Cateril had emerged. Nothing more had been said, but a frost had settled.</p><p>Kitty had realized then that in Lady Cateril&#x2019;s mind she had only one reason to exist: as Marcus&#x2019;s inconsolable widow. She was as much a monument to his magnificence as the marble plaque in the village church.</p><p><b>Captain Marcus Edward Cateril</b><br><br><b>of the 29th</b><br><br><b>Hero of Roleia</b><br><br><b>1782&#x2013;1815</b></p><br><p>The words were inscribed on a large alabaster bas-relief that included a shrouded, mourning woman drooping over a plinth. The plaque was white, but the figure was black. Kitty had assumed at first that it was a symbolic representation of grief, but she&#x2019;d since realized it was supposed to be her. Fixed in drooping black for all eternity.</p><p>She&#x2019;d worn half mourning since then, but when her mourning year had ended, she&#x2019;d lacked the fortitude to progress to bright colors. Her pretty clothes were stored away, becoming more out of style every day. She&#x2019;d tried to think of ways to escape, but here she still was, eighteen months after Marcus&#x2019;s death. She had hardly any money and no possibility of desirable employment. She&#x2019;d gone straight from school to marriage.</p><p>She picked up Sillikin. Through the most difficult times, the spaniel had been her confidant and consolation and had heard all that Kitty&#x2019;s pride had kept silent from people. We&#x2019;ll find a way, she said silently to the dog. There has to be a way&#x2014;</p><p>The door burst open and Lord Cateril entered, eyes wild. &#x201c;The most dreadful news!&#x201d;</p><p>Lady Cateril started upright, a hand to her chest. &#x201c;John?&#x201d; she gasped, meaning her surviving son. &#x201c;The children!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The princess. Princess Charlotte is dead!&#x201d;</p><p>There was a moment of stillness as Kitty and Lady Cateril took in his words. Princess Charlotte, second in line to the throne, who&#x2019;d been due to deliver her first child, the hope of the future, was dead?</p><p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d;</p><p>For once, Kitty and her mother-in-law were completely in harmony.</p><p>&#x201c;The child?&#x201d; Lady Cateril asked desperately.</p><p>&#x201c;A son. Also dead.&#x201d; Lord Cateril sank into a chair by his wife&#x2019;s side and took her hand. &#x201c;All hope is gone.&#x201d;</p><p>It was overly portentous, but Kitty knew what he meant. The king and queen had presented the nation with seventeen children, but now, nearly sixty years after George III had come to the throne, there had been only one legitimate grandchild, the Regent&#x2019;s daughter, Charlotte. With her dead, what would become of the nation? The king was old and mad and expected to die at any moment. The Regent was nearing sixty, grossly fat, and led a dissipated life. No one would be surprised if he died soon as well.</p><p>His sisters were all middle-aged, and those who had married hadn&#x2019;t produced offspring. Few of his brothers had married, and none of those unions had produced a living child. With the perversity of fate, some had bastards, which were of no use at all.</p><p>Kitty&#x2019;s heart ached for the people involved. &#x201c;Poor woman,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And her poor family. Royal, but not beyond the hand of fate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Amen,&#x201d; Lord Cateril said. &#x201c;The shops and theaters have closed in respect. The court has gone into mourning, of course. But I&#x2019;m told people of all degrees are putting on black, or at least dark bands.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We must do the same,&#x201d; Lady Cateril said. &#x201c;The family must wear full black.&#x201d; In spite of her genuine shock and sorrow, she shot Kitty a triumphant look.</p><p>Kitty almost protested, but Lord Cateril agreed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, my dear. And black bands, aprons, and gloves for the servants. Please gather the household together in the hall. I must read out the news.&#x201d;</p><p>Kitty helped to pass the word, and soon the family and servants stood together in the oak-paneled hall as Lord Cateril read out the letter he&#x2019;d received. All were affected and many wept. Afterward Kitty went to her room to put on one of her black gowns. If only she&#x2019;d given them away . . . but it was provident to keep mourning by. No one knew when death would strike, as had just been proved.</p><p>As a red-eyed housemaid fastened the back, Kitty resolved two things. She&#x2019;d return to half mourning after the funeral, along with everyone else except the court. And she would not live this half life any longer.</p><p>Somehow she&#x2019;d find a way to escape. Here was evidence that life was fleeting. She wouldn&#x2019;t waste what time she had left in the everlasting shadows of Lady Cateril&#x2019;s grief.</p><p>The princess&#x2019;s coffin, along with that of her stillborn child, was lowered into the royal vault at Windsor on November 15. Lord Cateril read a letter giving an account of the funeral to the assembled household, and they all prayed again for the princess and the bereaved family.</p><p>Kitty went upstairs to take off her black, tempted to move into brightly colored gowns now, but she truly was sorrowful over Princess Charlotte&#x2019;s fate, so half mourning felt correct. She chose gray and wore silver ornaments instead of jet. When she entered the parlor, Lady Cateril&#x2019;s look was flat, which seemed even worse than anger. Strenuous thinking over the past week had brought Kitty no closer to escape. The only prospect was to find employment. She&#x2019;d discussed the situation with her sister-in-law and raised the possibility that Sarah give her a reference.</p><p>&#x201c;Employment?&#x201d; Sarah had asked, eyes wide. &#x201c;Mama would never permit that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She can&#x2019;t stop me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But she can make my life miserable if I assist you.&#x201d; Sarah was plump, practical, and kind, but not courageous. She never tried to cross Lady Cateril over anything.</p><p>Kitty tried another approach. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think we should try to ease her out of her mourning? She has two fine children still, and six grandchildren&#x2014;yours and Anabel&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p><p>Anabel was Lady Cateril&#x2019;s youngest child, who&#x2019;d married a man who lived three counties away, probably by design. Anabel had as much spine as her mother, so they easily clashed.</p><p>&#x201c;She won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Sarah said. &#x201c;In some ways she likes the effect of it, but it reflects true grief. She always loved Marcus best.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t John mind?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s his father&#x2019;s favorite and he is the heir. Surely you&#x2019;re comfortable here overall, Kathryn. Why would you want to become someone&#x2019;s servant?&#x201d;</p><p>On the surface it was idiotic. She was treated as one of the family, with everything provided for her. She hardly ever had to touch the small sum left her by Marcus, for any bills were paid by Lord Cateril without complaint.</p><p>Kitty had told Sarah the truth. &#x201c;I want to wear rainbow colors and be joyful.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think governesses or companions are encouraged to dress gaudily, or romp around laughing.&#x201d;</p><p>Kitty had had to admit the truth of that, but it didn&#x2019;t change her mind. She was only twenty-seven years old and felt entombed.</p><p><br><b>Chapter 2</b></p><p>The next day, Kitty entered the parlor and found it empty. John and Sarah had driven out to visit friends who were celebrating the healthy birth of a child. Kitty could imagine how fearful the parents must have been with such a prominent example of the dangers. Lady Cateril must have been going over the household accounts with the housekeeper, for mourning had not led her to loose the reins of management. Lord Cateril would be in his office, where he spent most of his time when at home.</p><p>Kitty settled by the fire, Sillikin at her feet, to seek escape of another sort&#x2014;in the delightful adventures of Love in a Harem. She&#x2019;d enjoyed novels when young, but they&#x2019;d become a precious escape during her marriage. The unlikely adventures had transported her far from the Moor Street rooms in London that she and Marcus had called home. Marcus hadn&#x2019;t liked her to leave him alone, but as long as she was in the room with him, he hadn&#x2019;t minded her reading. In good times she&#x2019;d read to him, and they&#x2019;d chuckled together over the most implausible parts.</p><p>He would have enjoyed Love in a Harem. The heroine had been plain Jane Brown when she&#x2019;d set sail from Plymouth, but her ship had been captured by Barbary pirates and she&#x2019;d been sold into the harem of the Sultan of Turkey and renamed Pearl of the North. She&#x2019;d narrowly escaped being ravished by a number of men, including the captain of the ship, but now, trembling and dressed in the skimpiest silks, she awaited her lord and master. The harem door opened. . . .</p><p>&#x201c;Silent reading, Kathryn?&#x201d; Lady Cateril asked, coming in. &#x201c;You know I don&#x2019;t approve.&#x201d;</p><p>Suppressing some salty words she&#x2019;d learned from Marcus, Kitty did her best to be pleasant. &#x201c;Would you like me to read to you, Mama? You might enjoy Love in a Harem.&#x201d;</p><p>She heard her own words only as she spoke them and had to fight the giggles. &#x201c;Fulminating&#x201d; was exactly the word for the look she received. Kitty was saved from another unwise remark by Becky, the housemaid, coming in with a letter.</p><p>&#x201c;His lordship&#x2019;s sent this for Mrs. Marcus, milady.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked as if she might give it to Lady Cateril, so Kitty held out her hand. &#x201c;Thank you, Becky. It will be from my friend Ruth Lulworth,&#x201d; she told her mother-in-law, for Ruth was her only correspondent.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; Lady Cateril&#x2019;s expression lightened a little. Ruth was a clergyman&#x2019;s wife and thus approved of. She sat. &#x201c;You may read that to me.&#x201d;</p><p>It was revenge for that mischievous offer to read from the novel, and probably for Kitty&#x2019;s putting off mourning, but not worth fighting over. Kitty and Ruth were long past their school days, when they&#x2019;d shared all the anxieties, dreams, and longings of their silly hearts. The letter would contain news about Ruth&#x2019;s home and family, and of her work in the parish around the Gloucestershire village of Beecham Dabittot. Kitty broke the seal and unfolded the letter, but was startled to see that Ruth had written a great deal. To save the cost for the recipient, she&#x2019;d kept to one sheet of paper, turning it sideways and continuing the letter crossways. There were even a few lines on the diagonal. A sense of dramatic doings rose from the jumble, especially as one crosswise phrase stood out, because Ruth had underlined the &#x201c;Yes!&#x201d;</p><p>Yes! I&#x2019;m sure your astonishment equals mine.</p><p>At least that didn&#x2019;t sound like tragedy.</p><p>Kitty needed to read the astonishing news in private, but Lady Cateril was waiting. The beginning of the letter seemed to be normal news and she didn&#x2019;t think Lady Cateril could see the crossways writing, so she&#x2019;d make do.</p><br><p><i>My dear Kitty,</i></p><p><i>It&#x2019;s been a long time since I wrote, but we&#x2019;ve been very busy here in Beecham Dab. Such terrible news about Princess Charlotte. All around put on some mark of mourning, and we tolled the bells at the time of her interment. The tragedy is a reminder to us all to be mindful of our brief lives and the judgment to come.</i></p><p><i>Sadly, we have been visited by death more frequently than usual here this year. In August a sickness carried off ten souls and weakened many others, even at harvesttime, so Andrew went out when he could to help in the fields.</i></p><p><br>&#x201c;Andrew is Reverend Lulworth, Mama.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So I remember. A charitable act, but not, perhaps, suitable for a man of the cloth.&#x201d;</p><p>Kitty was tempted to debate how any charity could be unsuitable for a clergyman, but she returned to the letter.</p><p>By God&#x2019;s grace, we are all well. Little Arthur is babbling very cleverly for three. Maria is still quiet, but that makes her an easy babe.</p><p>Kitty remembered that Ruth&#x2019;s second birth had been difficult, but she and the child had survived, unlike poor Princess Charlotte.</p><p>She continued to read more descriptions of the children, the work of the parish, and about a pair of clever cats they&#x2019;d acquired who were...</p></p><h2>Creative You: Using Your Personality Type to Thrive</h2><p><b>No matter what your passion is&#x2014;business, technology, science, or plumbing&#x2014;this practical guide will enable you to unleash your innate creative skills based on your unique personality type and succeed in everything you do.</b><br><br>Whether you can admit it to yourself or not, you are creative.<br> <br>In today&#x2019;s complex world, creativity is the key to finding and living your passion.

These 100 haiku were chosen by editor Kazuaki Tanahashi and translated by Zen teacher Kate McCandless to celebrate Mitsu's 100th birthday on April 27, 2014. The introduction by Zen poet and priest Norman Fischer describes with loving detail a meeting with Mitsu at Rinso-in temple in 2010, considers the formative impact of war in Japan and social upheaval in America on her life, and places her poetry in the evolution of haiku as an international form.</p><p>Haiku is nothing if not fungible. This small, originally Japanese poetic form has traveled and evolved across cultures, languages, and centuries to contain as many meanings as dozens of generations' poets could concoct. Haiku can even accommodate an agenda, and <i>A White Tea Bowl</i> is very much an instrument of its publisher. Front and back matter weigh heavily with contributors' "remembrances," all more or less in the service of citing each contributor's relationship to the poet's husband and furthering Rodmell Press's stated aim: "It is our hope that our books will help individuals develop a more skillful [yoga, Buddhism, Taoism] practice." None of which overly dilutes this book's strengths, foremost the poems themselves. A dedicated practitioner of the form, Mitsu Suzuki wrote haiku for decades (not all "100 Years of Life," as the subtitle might have us believe), and of the thousands she composed, one hundred are here translated into Kate McCandless's feather-deft English and rendered beautifully beneath the original Japanese and a transliteration, one per page. To read them is to participate in a worthwhile celebration of a centenarian bard and, as the poet Jane Hirshfield writes, to find oneself "companioned in ways I cannot name but feel completely." -- <i>Jason Kirk</i>Mitsu Suzuki is the widow of Shunryu Suzuki Roshi, founder of San Francisco Zen Center. After he passed away in 1971, she remained at Zen Center where she taught tea ceremony and began writing poetry. Her first collection of haiku, <i>Temple Dust</i>, was published in 1992.</p><h2>The Tale of Despereaux: Being the Story of a Mouse, a Princess, Some Soup and a Spool of Thread</h2><p>This is the story of Desperaux Tilling, a mouse in love with music, stories, and a princess named Pea. It is also the story of Miggery Sow, a slow-witted serving girl with a simple, impossible wish. These characters are about to embark on a journey that will lead them down into a horrible dungeon, up into a glittering castle, and ultimately, into each other's lives.<br><br>And what happens then?<br><br>Listeners, it is your destiny to find out.</p><p>Kate DiCamillo, author of the Newbery Honor book <i>Because of Winn-Dixie</i>, spins a tidy tale of mice and men where she explores the "powerful, wonderful, and ridiculous" nature of love, hope, and forgiveness. Her old-fashioned, somewhat dark story, narrated "Dear Reader"-style, begins "within the walls of a castle, with the birth of a mouse." Despereaux Tilling, the new baby mouse, is different from all other mice. Sadly, the romantic, unmouselike spirit that leads the unusually tiny, large-eared mouse to the foot of the human king and the beautiful Princess Pea ultimately causes him to be banished by his own father to the foul, rat-filled dungeon.<p> The first book of four tells Despereaux's sad story, where he falls deeply in love with Princess Pea and meets his cruel fate. The second book introduces another creature who differs from his peers--Chiaroscuro, a rat who instead of loving the darkness of his home in the dungeon, loves the light so much he ends up in the castle&amp; in the queen's soup. The third book describes young Miggery Sow, a girl who has been "clouted" so many times that she has cauliflower ears. Still, all the slow-witted, hard-of-hearing Mig dreams of is wearing the crown of Princess Pea. The fourth book returns to the dungeon-bound Despereaux and connects the lives of mouse, rat, girl, and princess in a dramatic denouement.</p><p> Children whose hopes and dreams burn secretly within their hearts will relate to this cast of outsiders who desire what is said to be out of their reach and dare to break "never-to-be-broken rules of conduct." Timothy Basil Ering's pencil illustrations are stunning, reflecting DiCamillo's extensive light and darkness imagery as well as the sweet, fragile nature of the tiny mouse hero who lives happily ever after.

The result is a wise approach to dealing with human problems that is both optimistic and realistic, even in the most challenging times.<br><br>How can we expect to find happiness and meaning in our lives when the modern world seems such an unhappy place? <br><br>His Holiness the Dalai Lama has suffered enormously throughout his life, yet he always seems to be smiling and serene. How does he do it? In <i>The Art of Happiness in a Troubled World</i>, Dr. Cutler walks readers through the Dalai Lama's philosophy on how to achieve peace of mind and come to terms with life's inherent suffering. Together, the two examine the roots of many of the problems facing the world and show us how we can approach these calamities in a way that alleviates suffering, and helps us along in our personal quests to be happy. Through stories, meditations, and in-depth conversations, the Dalai Lama teaches readers to identify the cultural influences and ways of thinking that lead to personal unhappiness, making sense of the hardships we face personally, as well as the afflictions suffered by others.</p><p>His Holiness the Dalai Lama is the spiritual and temporal leader of the Tibetan people.

But whether it is an old friend or a new friend, there's not much difference anyway, because I always believe we are the same: We are all just human beings. -H.H. THE DALAI LAMA, SPEAKING TO A CROWD OF MANY THOUSANDS<br><br>Time passes. The world changes. But there is one constant I have grown used to over the years, while intermittently traveling on speaking tours with the Dalai Lama: When speaking to a general audience, he invariably opens his address, "We are all the same . . ."<br><br>Once establishing a bond with each member of the audience in that way, he then proceeds to that evening's particular topic. But over the years I've witnessed a remarkable phenomenon: Whether he is speaking to a small formal meeting of leaders on Capitol Hill, addressing a gathering of a hundred thousand in Central Park, an interfaith dialogue in Australia, or a scientific conference in Switzerland, or teaching twenty thousand monks in India, one can sense an almost palpable effect. He seems to create a feeling among his audience not only of connection to him, but of connection to one another, a fundamental human bond.<br><br>It was early on a Monday morning and I was back in Dharamsala, scheduled to meet shortly with the Dalai Lama for our first meeting in a fresh series of discussions. Home to a thriving Tibetan community, Dharamsala is a tranquil village built into a ridge of the Dauladar mountain range, the foothills of the Himalayas in northern India. I had arrived a few days earlier, around the same time as the Dalai Lama himself, who had just returned home from a three-week speaking tour in the United States.<br><br>I finished breakfast early, and as the Dalai Lama's residence was only a five-minute walk along a mountain path from the guesthouse where I was staying, I retired to the common room to finish my coffee and review my notes in preparation for our meeting. Though the room was deserted, someone had left on the TV tuned to the world news. Absorbed in my notes, I wasn't paying much attention to the news and for several minutes the suffering of the world was nothing but background noise.<br><br>It wasn't long, however, before I happened to look up and a story caught my attention. A Palestinian suicide bomber had detonated an explosive at a Tel Aviv disco, deliberately targeting Israeli boys and girls. Almost two dozen teenagers were killed. But killing alone apparently was not satisfying enough for the terrorist. He had filled his bomb with rusty nails and screws for good measure, in order to maim and disfigure those whom he couldn't kill.<br><br>Before the immense cruelty of such an act could fully sink in, other news reports quickly followed-a bleak mix of natural disasters and intentional acts of violence . . . the Crown Prince of Nepal slaughters his entire family . . . survivors of the Gujarat earthquake still struggle to recover.<br><br>Fresh from accompanying the Dalai Lama on his recent tour, I found that his words "We are all the same" rang in my head as I watched these horrifying stories of suddenly suffering and misery. I then realized I had been listening to these reports as if the victims were vague, faceless abstract entities, not a group of individuals "the same as me." It seemed that the greater the sense of distance between me and the victim, the less real they seemed to be, the less like living, breathing human beings. But now, for a moment, I tried to imagine what it would be like to be one of the earthquake victims, going about my usual daily chores one moment and seventy-five seconds later having no family, home, or possessions, suddenly becoming penniless and alone.<br><br>"We are all the same." It was a powerful principle, and one that I was convinced could change the world.<br>"Your Holiness," I began, "I'd like to talk with you this morning about this idea that we are all the same. You know, in today's world there is such a pervasive feeling of isolation and alienation among people, a feeling of separateness, even suspicion. It seems to me that if we could somehow cultivate this sense of connection to others, a real sense of connection on a deep level, a common bond, I think it could completely transform society. It could eliminate so many of the problems facing the world today. So this morning I'd like to talk about this principle that we are all the same, and-"<br><br>"We are all the same?" the Dalai Lama repeated.<br><br>"Yes, and-"<br><br>"Where did you get this idea?" he asked.<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>"Who gave you this idea?"<br><br>"You . . . you did," I stammered, a bit confused.<br><br>"Howard," he said bluntly, "we are not all the same. We're different! Everybody is different."<br><br>"Yes, of course," I quickly amended myself, "we all have these superficial differences, but what I mean is-"<br><br>"Our differences are not necessarily superficial," he persisted. "For example, there is one senior Lama I know who is from Ladakh. Now, I am very close to this Lama, but at the same time, I know that he is a Ladakhee. No matter how close I may feel toward this person,<br><br>it's never going to make him Tibetan. The fact remains that he is a Ladakhee."<br><br>I had heard the Dalai Lama open his public addresses with "We are all the same" so often over the years that this turn of conversation was starting to stagger me.<br><br>"Well, on your tours over the years, whenever you speak to big audiences, and even on this most recent, you always say, 'We are all the same.' That seems like a really strong theme in your public talks. For example, you say how people tend to focus on our differences, but we are all the same in terms of our desire to be happy and avoid suffering, and-"<br><br>"Oh yes. Yes," he acknowledged. "And also we have the same human potential. Yes, I generally begin my talk with these things. This is because many different people come to see me. Now I am a Buddhist monk. I am Tibetan. Maybe others' backgrounds are different. So if we had no common basis, if we had no characteristics that we share, then there is no point in my talk, no point in sharing my views. But the fact is that we are all human beings. That is the very basis upon which I'm sharing my personal experience with them."<br><br>"That is the kind of idea I was getting at-this idea that we are all human beings," I explained, relieved that we were finally on the same page. "I think if people really had a genuine feeling inside, that all human beings were the same and they were the same as other people, it would completely transform society . . . I mean in a genuine way. So, I'm hoping we can explore this issue a little bit."<br><br>The Dalai Lama responded, "Then to really try to understand this, we need to investigate how we come to think of ourselves as independent, isolated or separate, and how we view others as different or separate, and see if we can come to a deeper understanding. But we cannot start from the standpoint of saying simply we are all the same and denying that there are differences."<br><br>"Well, that is kind of my point. I think we can agree that if people related to each other as fellow human beings, if everyone related to other people like you do, on that basic human level, like brothers and sisters, as I've heard you refer to people, the world would be a far better place. We wouldn't have all these problems that I want to talk to you about later, and you and I could talk about football games or movies instead!<br><br>"So, I don't know," I continued, "but it seems that your approach to building the sense of connection between people is to remind them of the characteristics they share as human beings. The way you do whenever you have the opportunity to speak to a large audience."<br><br>"Yes." He nodded.<br><br>"I don't know . . ." I repeated again. "It is such an important topic, so simple an idea yet so difficult in reality, that I'm just wondering if there are any other methods of facilitating that process, like speeding it up, or motivating people to view things from that perspective, given the many problems in the world today."<br><br>"Other methods . . ." he said slowly, taking a moment to carefully consider the question while I eagerly anticipated his insights and wisdom. Suddenly he started to laugh. As if he had a sudden epiphany, he exclaimed, "Yes! Now if we could get beings from Mars to come down to the earth, and pose some kind of threat, then I think you would see all the people on Earth unite very quickly! They would join together, and say, 'We, the people of the earth!' " He continued laughing.<br><br>Unable to resist his merry laugh, I also began to laugh. "Yes, I guess that would about do it," I agreed. "And I'll see what I can do to speak to the Interplanetary Council about it. But in the meantime, while we're all waiting for the Mothership to arrive, any other suggestions?"<br>Thus we began a series of conversations that would continue intermittently for several years. The discussion began that morning with my casually tossing around the phrase "We are all the same" as if I was coming up with a slogan for a soft drink ad that was going to unite the world. The Dalai Lama responded with his characteristic refusal to reduce important questions to simplistic formulas. These were critical human questions: How can we establish a deep feeling of connection to others, a genuine human bond, including those who may be very different? Is it possible to even view your enemy as a person essentially like yourself? Is it possible to really see all human beings as one's brothers and sisters, or is this a utopian dream?<br><br>Our discussions soon broadened to address other fundamental issues dealing with the relationship between the individual and society. Serious questions were at stake: Is it possible to be truly happy when social problems invariably impact our personal happiness? In seeking happiness do we choose the path of inner development or social change?<br><br>As our discussions progressed, the Dalai Lama addressed these questions not as abstract concepts or philosophical speculation but as realities within the context of our everyday lives, quickly revealing how these questions are directly related to very real problems and concerns.<br><br>In these first discussions in Dharamsala, we dealt with the challenge of how to shift one's orientation from Me to We. Less than a year later, I returned to Dharamsala for our second series of conversations-September 11 had occurred in the interim, initiating the worldwide War on Terror. It was clear that cultivating a We orientation was not enough. Acutely reminded that where there is a "we" there is also a "they," we now had to face the potential problems raised by an "us against them" mind-set: prejudice, suspicion, indifference, racism, conflict, violence, cruelty, and a wide spectrum of ugly and terrible attitudes with which human beings can treat one another.<br><br>When we met in Tucson, Arizona, several years later, the Dalai Lama began to weave together the ideas from our many conversations on these topics, presenting a coherent approach to coping with our troubled world, explaining how to maintain a feeling of hope and even happiness despite the many problems of today's world.<br><br>But that Monday morning we began on the most fundamental level, exploring our customary notions about who we are and how we relate to the world around us, beginning with how we relate to those in our own communities and the role that plays in our personal and societal happiness.<br><br>"No Sense of Community, No Anchor"<br><br>On a recent Friday afternoon, an unemployed twenty-year-old posted a message on YouTube, simply offering to "be there" for anyone who needed to talk. "I never met you, but I do care," he said.<br><br>By the end of the weekend, he had received more than five thousand calls and text messages from strangers taking him up on his offer.<br><br>Continuing our discussion, I reviewed. "You know, Your Holiness, our discussions over the years have revolved around the theme of human happiness. In the past we discussed happiness from the individual standpoint, from the standpoint of inner development. But now we are talking about human happiness at the level of society, exploring some of the societal factors that may affect human happiness. I know of course that you have had the opportunity to travel around the world many times, visiting many different countries, so many different cultures, as well as meeting with many different kinds of people and experts in so many fields."<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"So, I was just wondering-in the course of your travels, is there any particular aspect of modern society that you have noticed that you feel acts as a major obstruction to the full expression of human happiness? Of course, there are many specific problems in today's world, like violence, racism, terrorism, the gap between rich and poor, the environment, and so on. But here I'm wondering if there is more of a general feature of society that stands out in your mind as particularly significant?"<br><br>Seated upon a wide upholstered chair, the Dalai Lama bent down to unlace his plain brown shoes while he silently reflected on the question. Then, tucking his feet under him in a cross-legged position,<br><br>settling in for a deeper discussion, he replied, "Yes. I was just thinking there is one thing I have noticed, something that is very important. I think it could be best characterized as a lack of sense of community. Tibetans are always shocked to hear of situations where people are living in close proximity, have neighbors, and they may have been your neighbors for months or even years, but you have hardly any contact with them! So you might simply greet them when you meet, but otherwise you don't know them. There is no real connection. There is no sense of community. These situations we always find very surprising, because in the traditional Tibetan society, the sense of community is very strong."<br><br>The Dalai Lama's comment hit home with me-literally and figuratively. I thought, not without some embarrassment, that I myself didn't know the names of my neighbors. Nor had I known my neighbors' names for many years.<br><br>Of course, I was not about to admit that now. "Yes," I said, "you will certainly see those kinds of situations."<br><br>The Dalai Lama went on to explain, "In today's world you will sometimes find these communities or societies where there is no spirit of cooperation, no feeling of connection. Then you'll see widespread loneliness set in. I feel that a sense of community is so important. I mean even if you are very rich, if you don't have human companions or friends to share your love with, sometimes you end up simply sharing it with a pet, an animal, which is better than nothing. However, even if you are in a poor community, the poor will have each other. So there is a real sense that you have a kind of an anchor, an emotional anchor. Whereas, if this sense of community is lacking, then when you feel lonely, and when you have pain, there is no one to really share it with. I think this kind of loneliness is probably a major problem in today's world, and can certainly affect an individual's day-to-day happiness.</p><h2>Unifying Political Methodology: The Likelihood Theory of Statistical Inference</h2><p><p>One of the hallmarks of the development of political science as a discipline has been the creation of new methodologies by scholars within the discipline--methodologies that are well-suited to the analysis of political data. Gary King has been a leader in the development of these new approaches to the analysis of political data. In his book, <i>Unifying Political Methodology</i>, King shows how the likelihood theory of inference offers a unified approach to statistical modeling for political research and thus enables us to better analyze the enormous amount of data political scientists have collected over the years. Newly reissued, this book is a landmark in the development of political methodology and continues to challenge scholars and spark controversy.<br></p> <p>"Gary King's <i>Unifying Political Methodology</i> is at once an introduction to the likelihood theory of statistical inference and an evangelist's call for us to change our ways of doing political methodology. One need not accept the altar call to benefit enormously from the book, but the intellectual debate over the call for reformation is likely to be the enduring contribution of the work."<br></p> <p>--Charles Franklin, <i>American Political Science Review</i><br></p> <p>"King's book is one of the only existing books which deal with political methodology in a clear and consistent framework. The material in it is now and will continue to be essential reading for all serious students and researchers in political methodology." --R. Michael Alvarez, California Institute of Tech-nology<br></p> <p>Gary King is Professor of Government, Harvard University. One of the leading thinkers in political methodology, he is the author of <i>A Solution to the Ecological Inference Problem: Reconstructing Individual Behavior from Aggregate Data</i> and other books and articles.<br></p></p><p>In this book the author demonstrates the utility of the likelihood theory of statistical inference as a basic, unifying approach to statistical modelling for political research. This approach encourages the tailoring of models to particular phenomena studied...&#34;.the presentation is quite readable and does not demand more than is reasonable....this is a superb book for learning about likelihood methods and their applications. King balances theory with application and keeps his audience clearly in mind. The book could be read by students with only a single course in probability theory and statistical inference as background.&#34; Charles H.

Gleaned from the written record of stories told over a period of many years, they provide life changing perceptions of spiritual realities that often escape the modern mind. Stories hold the key to unlocking the human heart by revealing the eternal verities that can remove the barriers blinding one&#39;s spiritual insight and hearing, and they create a taste for spiritual things in one&#39;s soul, a taste that leads one to explore the great wealth of the spiritual world.

In the context of the Iranian culture (or the Middle East, for that matter), stories are used to make a point: moral, philosophical or spiritual. And no one ever better used the medium for those purposes than the Master. For the reader it is a joy to have them available in one volume. Such stories should not be neglected or lost by the passage of time.

This volume should be read for pleasure, but would do equally well as an instruction manual for aspiring writers.&#34; --Publishers Weekly (starred review) &#34;Joseph Heywood knows his poachers, deer-baiters, and road-beer-drinking yahoos, as well as his cross-dressing informants and Elvis impersonators, but his most compelling characters are the hardworking and embattled conservation officers, the quietly heroic men and women who enforce the law evenhandedly against a well-armed slice of citizenry. Heywood is at his finest and funniest in these short stories from Michigan&#39;s Upper Peninsula, where cold kills and night can be as &#39;black as the inside of a cow.&#39; These detective stories are a great contribution to the rural American literary tradition, with nods to Mark Twain, Robert Travers, Jim Harrison, Cully Gage, and Dashiell Hammett.&#34; --Bonnie Jo Campbell, author of Once Upon a River and American Salvage, a National Book Award finalist &#34;Joseph Heywood has a great ear for the vernacular of some of America&#39;s more colorful backwoods &#39;citizens, &#39; the cast for this wild set of tales. Even more incredible is his ability to see into the wild hearts of a wide range of wonderfully flawed human beings and the cops and conservation officers who try to keep them under control. This is full throttle writing, the kind of stuff you can&#39;t put down to pick up the remote. Heywood is a compelling writer who has obviously done his time in the woods and lived to come back to tell us what it&#39;s really like out there.&#34; --Michael Delp, author of As If We Were Prey and The Last Good Water</p><h2>Notes on the Assemblage</h2><p><p><strong>The Books We Love in 2016 - <em>The New Yorker</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Best Poetry Collections of 2015 - <em>The Washington Post</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Best Books 2015: Poetry - <em>Library Journal</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Best Books of 2015 - NPR Books</strong></p> <p><strong>16 Best Poetry Books of 2015 - <em>BuzzFeed Books</em></strong></p> <p>Juan Felipe Herrera, the first Latino Poet Laureate of the United States and son of Mexican immigrants, grew up in the migrant fields of California.</p> <p>Exuberant and socially engaged, reflective and healing, this collection of new work from the nation's first Latino Poet Laureate is brimming with the wide-open vision and hard-won wisdom of a poet whose life and creative arc have spanned chasms of culture in an endless crossing, dreaming and back again.</p> <p>"[This year] Juan Felipe Herrera's <em>Notes on the Assemblage</em> has been a ladder of hope ..."&#x2014;<strong>Ada Lim�n, <em>The New Yorker</em></strong></p> <p>"Juan Felipe Herrera's family has gone from migrant worker to poet laureate of the United States in one generation.

Many poets since the 1960s have dreamed of a new hybrid art, part oral, part written, part English, part something else: an art grounded in ethnic identity, fueled by collective pride, yet irreducibly individual too.

Eric McHenry, <i>The New York Times</i></p><p> Juan Felipe Herrera&#x2019;s appointment is a timely one, particularly as we enter an election year that&#x2019;s fraught with the usual anxiety and misinformation about immigration issues.

Wound even more tightly than his previous collections As always, Herrera&#x2019;s signature language is immediate, visceral, in the moment, sometimes razzy-jazzy, and compacted to create intensive feeling. Urgently written and important to read, even if Herrera weren&#x2019;t in the Library of Congress limelight.&#x201d; <i>Library Journal</i>, starred review</p><p>"<i>Notes on the Assemblage</i> provides a splendid introduction to the expansive work of Juan Felipe Herrera, the nation&#x2019;s new poet laureate. The son of migrant farm workers, Herrera powerfully conveys the experience of migrants who have languished in detention camps and feel apprehensive as they approach the U.S. border. He also knows, firsthand, the frustration of being labeled 'half Mexican,' as if he were neither a true Mexican nor a real American Herrera&#x2019;s background as a performance artist shows in many poems, which come alive when read aloud. Herrera, who has published multiple poetry collections and young-adult novels, easily handles an array of topics and knows how to capture both the pulse of the news and timeless subjects such as people&#x2019;s deep longings for justice. The collection ends with a moving poem about the nine people killed this year in a South Carolina church: 'they are not 9 they / are each one / alive / we do not know / you have a poem to offer / it is made of action you must / search for it run.&#x2019;&#x201d; <i>The Washington Post</i></p><p>"Herrera&#x2019;s new bilingual collection arrives in the same month as his appointment as the 21st US Poet Laureate, and the first ever Hispanic person to hold the office, goes into effect. Herrera offers glorious reflections: 'it can begin with clouds how they fray how they enter / then how they envelop the earth.' He also conjures powerful outcries, like his poem 'Ayotzinapa,' which honors '42 students from the Ayotzinapa Normal School [who] went missing after police in the city of Iguala, Guerrero, Mexico opened fire on their buses and kidnapped a group of 43.' And his poem 'Almost Livin&#x2019; Almost Dyin&#x2019;' honors Michael Brown, whose death at the hands of a police officer set off protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. Herrera offers intimate odes to recently departed poets Wanda Coleman and Jack Gilbert, Jayne Cortez, Phil Levine, Jos� Montoya. This is Herrera at his best, a poet who chronicles our times." BBC</p><p>"This has the feeling of a homecoming, from its dedication to the late Michele Serros to its encomia for Wanda Coleman, Jack Gilbert and Jayne Cortez. And why not? Herrera, the former California poet laureate who was named U.S. poet laureate in June, has long written out of a sense of community. This new collection is generous, unexpected, playful and pointed, reminding us of our shared humanity. 'we are all still burnin&#x2019;,' he declares in 'Almost Livin' Almost Dyin&#x2019;.' 'can you feel me swaggin' tall and driving low&#x2019;&#x201d; <i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>"In his newest volume of poetry, Notes on the Assemblage, Herrera reflects on the deaths of black Americans at the hands of police officers, the disappearance of 43 students in Mexico, his Mexican heritage, and the meaning of art. Herrera pivots from the political to the poignant, calling out the absurdities and sweet moments of modern life.&#x201d; <i>The Boston Globe</i></p><p>"Juan Felipe Herrera is at the top of his game Concurrent with his assumption of the Laureateship is his new book, <i>Notes on the Assemblage</i>, which shows off this writer's many strengths and varied capacities This is deep yet accessible stuff, pertinent to all of this book's political concerns, yet metaphysical and existential in a basic way that any poetry reader can relate to. Herrera, who ambivalently describes himself in another poem as 'One half Mexican the other half/ Mexican, then the half against itself,' also posits himself as an everyman, as bewildered as the rest of us he's ready to carry his poems tall on our behalf, and for us to join him.&#x201d; Craig Morgan Teicher, NPR Books</p><p>"Herrera&#x2019;s pacifist sentiments surface throughout the collection, an assemblage indeed of moments that demand pause, reflection, and ultimately, action The lesson in <i>Notes on the Assemblage</i> [is] to shorten the distance to knowledge and awareness, to close the space between those who suffer and those who can respond to that suffering. Call it building community or call it healing, in Herrera&#x2019;s books it is absolutely an essential responsibility because it generates, above all else, hope.&#x201d; <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></p><p> [Juan Felipe Herrera] has captured here on the page with words what is both tangible and ephemeral, the exquisite and the political, and he has accomplished the difficult feat of not being trite under the circumstances. He has done it with grace and with spacing that sets a visual pace that provides perfect scaffolding.&#x201d; <i>The Rumpus</i></p><p>"<i>Notes on the Assemblage</i> brings a sorrowful beat and a doleful swagger to subjects as urgent as the Black Lives Matter movement and the daily swell of atrocities weathered in Mexico Linking themes as disparate as the LA Riots and avant-garde Italian cinema, there is a tone of casual esotericism in his verse. Herrera&#x2019;s lines often ape e.e. cummings, and more or less assume the reader&#x2019;s familiarity with the dadaist Hugo Ball. However obscure his arcana might be, the poet&#x2019;s voice remains gracious and non-exclusive. If there is a brotherhood out there, he seems to say, it is forged around the pangs of threat that compel people to unite and to incite. As far as Chicano literature is concerned, those corridos that started it all went on to find their most recognizable form over a century later with the work of Rudolfo Anaya before happily culminating into a kind of universal crossover appeal with the adolescence-centered stories of Sandra Cisneros. Herrera&#x2019;s work, sticking to the strictures of sound and symbol, offers ample example that this socially conscious class of literature might work best as it approaches song." <i>San Antonio Current</i></p><p>"The latest collection from Juan Felipe Herrera, the nation's new poet laureate, covers an expansive range of forms: elegies for lost friends, long polyvocal narratives, ekphrastic poems, language splintered into shapes. Frequently profound and often furious, the collection is at its most agonized when Herrera rages against an epidemic of unjust deaths: '&amp; your body's / on the fence &amp; your ID's in the air &amp; the shots / get fired.' He even fits danger and sorrow into white space." Camila Domonoske, NPR's <i>The Two-Way</i></p><p>"Newly appointed U.S. Poet Laureate Juan Felipe Herrera&#x2019;s <i>Notes on the Assemblage</i> is an urgent, powerful collection with impressive range Herrera&#x2019;s poignant poems address everything from ongoing political issues in America to his Mexican heritage and experience as the son of migrant workers. <i>Notes on the Assemblage</i> is more than merely important; it is essential, a must-read.&#x201d; <i>BuzzFeed</i></p><p>"In <i>Notes on the Assemblage</i>, U.S. Poet Laureate Juan Felipe Herrera appeals to Americans and artists. Herrera&#x2019;s forceful poetry speaks directly and powerfully, like the address of a leader rousing his battalions to action: 'freedom for you for me why do we / not speak.' Looking directly at the most devastating events of our moment 'the man with the choke-hold,' the '9 killed in Charleston, South Carolina,&#x2019; 'Trayvon Martin face down' he forces us to confront society and its paradoxes. His summons links unadorned, unforgiving description with figurative language: 'each bone / cannot be chained to the abyss'; 'why / does it / blossom torches.' Indeed, the eradication of binaries (law versus freedom; art versus life; Spanish versus English) is central to Herrera&#x2019;s work. Poems throughout the collection appear first in Spanish and then in English. At their most powerful these pieces infuse each language with the other:' de las cumbres brujas ripping spirit flesh blue madness locuras dentro.' Herrera also obliterates the passive relationship between a work of art and its observer. He is intimately concerned with what art does, 'it follows you passes you dissolves ahead of you where / it is waiting for you when you get there you will not / know it until you see that it is seeing you seeing you.' The stakes of this engagement for our communal body are viscerally felt: 'we are not what we thought it is / not who we were or / what we want to be.&#x2019;" <i>Boston Review</i></p><p> United States Poet Laureate Juan Felipe Herrera is the son of immigrants, and his poetry collection <i>Notes on the Assemblage</i> touches on the migrant experience and politics, subjects that take on considerable weight particularly during an election year.&#x201d; <i>Florida Agenda</i></p><br></p><h2>Faithful to Laura (A Middlefield Family Novel)</h2><p><p><strong>Laura&#x2019;s Amish faith requires her to forgive, but she can only think of revenge.</strong></p><p>Laura Stutzman leaves her Kentucky community for Middlefield, Ohio, with one purpose: to find Mark King, the man who pledged his love to her, then left.

The Germans had a secret transmitter on one of their ships in the neutral harbour of Goa. Its purpose was to guide the U-boats against Allied shipping in the Indian Ocean. There seemed no way for the British to infringe Goa&#x2019;s Portuguese neutrality by force. But the transmitter had to be silenced. SOE was tasked with dealing with the problem, but how? Then it was remembered that 1,400 miles away in Calcutta was a source of possible help. A group of civilian bankers, merchants and solicitors were the remains of an old territorial unit called The Calcutta Light Horse.</p><p>James Leasor was educated at The City of London School and Oriel College, Oxford.

Essentially, I&#x2019;ve had the most creative freedom I&#x2019;ve ever had on any licensed book ever and because it&#x2019;s weekly, I get to tell any story I can think of. Yes, we&#x2019;ve told a huge arcing story about Superman getting more and more controlling and Batman and Superman splitting up as friends. But we&#x2019;ve also told these one shots out of the middle of nowhere, like Superman and Flash playing super speed chess and Green Arrow and Harley Quinn just having a little adventure in a very funny, poignant, and sad story. The Flash also goes running across the Nullarbor in Australia. People have loved these stories and it&#x2019;s kept things very fresh. Even though some of them haven&#x2019;t appealed to everybody, the fact that it&#x2019;s a weekly comic is exhausting and I don&#x2019;t get a lot of sleep, but I still want to put absolutely everything into every issue. I agonize over every syllable.</p> <p> <strong>Q:</strong><strong> It&#x2019;s very apparent that you&#x2019;re having fun with this story and I think that&#x2019;s why everybody loves reading it. Do you have a favorite issue or an issue that you think people should go back to if they&#x2019;ve only read Issue #1 or only played the video game?</strong></p> <p> A: For people who are worried about the violence and darkness of it, they should definitely check out Chapter 5. It&#x2019;s that Green Arrow and Harley Quinn issue which is probably still my favorite issue, it&#x2019;s not very Injustice but it&#x2019;s just great. Its throwing together two wonderful characters that have never really mixed before. There&#x2019;s also a Flash story in Chapter 13 where Superman, Wonder Woman, and Flash come to Australia to break up a protest and that&#x2019;s a story that everyone seems to love, a lot of people have told me that&#x2019;s their favorite. The whole run has been fun and I know a lot of people have been hesitant at the start because some truly horrible things happen. Some nasty things happen that I didn&#x2019;t even want to write or read but if they can get past that there are some stories that aren&#x2019;t so dark and some stories that have a lot of humor. If I&#x2019;m going to recommend one? I&#x2019;d recommend all of them, read everything so far, that&#x2019;s a good place to start.</p> <p> <strong>Q:</strong><strong> You bring up a funny point because even though the world is so dark in this alternate universe, so many of these characters would handle it with humor. Even with everything happening some of them have to laugh to survive.</strong></p> <p>A: That&#x2019;s exactly it. I hate writing without humor, I can&#x2019;t stand anything humorless. You know, I have a sense of humor and I believe other people do too and telling superhero stories without any lightness and levity is just not the way to go. Batman can do that but no one else can. Even a world turning to dark needs laughter.</p>TOM TAYLOR is the creator of the Aurealis-Award Winning graphic novel series THE DEEP (which tells the adventures of a multiethnic family of underwater explorers who live on a submarine). <i>The Deep</i> has been optioned by Technicolor to be turned into a 26 episode CG animated series.

This is an exposition of 2 Corinthians 3:17-18.<br><br>The original title of this study was <i>The Excellency of the Gospel above the Law</i>. In it Sibbes described the fuller self-revelation of God in the coming of Christ and its greater effect in those who behold that glory by the Spirit. The vitality of the new covenant results in spiritual liberty and likeness to Christ. <br><br>Thomas Goodwin and Philip Nye supervised the first edition of this work which was first published in 1639, four years after Sibbes' death. They described it as showing 'the liberty of the sons of God... the image of their graces here and glory hereafter' and as providing 'much comfort and great encouragement to all (who) begin timely and continue constantly in the ways of God'. <br><br>The text of the original treatise is reproduced here with the minimum of editing.</p><p>Richard Sibbes was born at Tostock, Suffolk, in 1577 and went to school in Bury St Edmunds. His father, 'a good sound-hearted Christian', at first intended that Richard should follow his own trade as a wheelwright, but the boy's 'strong inclination to his books, and well-profiting therein' led to his going up to St John's College, Cambridge in 1595. He was converted around 1602-3 through the powerful ministry of Paul Bayne, the successor of William Perkins in the pulpit of Great St Andrew's Church.<br><br> After earning his B.D. in 1610, Sibbes was appointed a lecturer at Holy Trinity Church, Cambridge. Later, through the influence of friends, he was chosen to be the preacher at Gray's Inn, London, and he remained there until 1626. In that year he returned to Cambridge as Master of St Catherine's Hall, and later returned to Holy Trinity, this time as its vicar. He was granted a Doctorate in Divinity in 1627, and was thereafter frequently referred to as 'the heavenly Doctor Sibbes'. He continued to exercise his ministry at Gray's Inn, London, and Holy Trinity, Cambridge, until his death on 6 July 1635 at the age of 58.<br><br> The Trust publishes the Works of Richard Sibbes in seven volumes, together with a number of his writings in the Puritan Paperbacks and Pocket Puritans series. Volume 1 of the Works contains a Memoir of Sibbes by the editor, Alexander B.

In the chapter "The Maryland Toleration Act," we learn that this document was one of the first blueprints for modern religious tolerance. "<i>Common Sense</i>" depicts the Boston Tea Party and the British response as the prelude to Paine's stirring pamphlet. And "The Louisiana Purchase" closes with Lewis and Clark setting off to map Jefferson's "empire of liberty." </p><p>As Ashby and Col�n show, the creation of that empire resulted in immense prosperity but also meant the extension of slavery and the forcible removal of the Native Americans. Their balanced and teachable theme is that these twenty documents reveal our early struggles to live up to the principles of liberty and equality. This graphic primer is an indispensable resource for students and anyone else who wants the facts of American history close at hand.</p></p><p><p><b>Ruth Ashby</b> is the author of more than thirty books for children and young adults. A former book editor, she teaches English at the Portledge School in Locust Valley, New York. </p><p><b>Ernie Col�n</b> is the illustrator of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The 9/11 Report: A Graphic Adaptation</i>, <i>After 9/11: America's War on Terror (2001&#x2015; )</i>, <i>Che: A Graphic Biography</i>, and <i>Anne Frank: The Anne Frank House Authorized Graphic Biography</i> (all published by Hill and Wang). He has worked at Marvel and at DC Comics, where he oversaw the production for <i>Green Lantern</i>, <i>Wonder Woman</i>, <i>Blackhawk</i>, and <i>The Flash</i>. </p><p>Ruth Ashby and Ernie Col�n live in Huntington, New York</p>*Starred Review* Ashby, the author of many biographies and histories for youth (The Amazing Mr. Franklin, 2004), and her well-known cartoonist husband, Col�n (Inner Sanctum, 2011), breathe accessible and cogent life into the written documents that formed U.S. policy, beginning with the Mayflower Compact (1620) and ending with the Indian Removal Act (1830). With a knowledgeable, engaging Uncle Sam as narrator, Ashby and Col�n lay out the events and beliefs leading to the development of each document, and quoted snippets from each give further insight into their powerful words. Col�n uses well-designed, full-color panel layouts to eloquently blend charts and other informative graphics with straightforward images of events, clothing, and customs as well as clear, concise metaphors, all with an eye toward promoting a solid understanding of the basic facts and their impact. For readers unmoved by the importance of the documents alone, Ashby and Col�n emphasize how words that were controversial in the past continue to be controversial today&#x2014;for instance, a spread exploring the Constitution&#x2019;s goal of promoting &#x201c;the general welfare&#x201d; includes an illustration of a line of people at a contemporary Social Security office. School libraries would do well to include this engaging volume in their history collections. Grades 9-12. --Francisca Goldsmith</p><h2>Flesh Wounds: An Inspector Troy Novel (The Inspector Troy Novels)</h2><p>Praised for their riveting, ingenious plot twists, John Lawton's series of espionage thrillers featuring Chief Inspector Frederick Troy of Scotland Yard have an uncanny ability to place readers in the thick of history. Now in <i>Flesh Wounds</i>, an old flame has returned to Troy's life: Kitty Stilton, wife of an American presidential hopeful. Private eye Joey Rork has been hired to make sure Kitty's amorous liaisons with a rat pack crooner don't ruin her husband's political career. But he also wants to know why Kitty has been spotted with Danny Ryan, whose twin brothers, in addition to owning one of London's hottest jazz clubs, are said to have inherited the crime empire of fallen mobster Alf Marx. Before Rork can find out, he meets a gruesome end. And he isn't the only one: bodies have started turning up around London, dismembered in the same bizarre and horrifying way. Is it possible that the blood trail leads back to Troy's own police force and into Troy's own forgotten past? <i>Flesh Wounds</i>, a compulsively readable thriller, finds one of our most able storytellers at the height of his game.</p><p>John Lawton is a descendant of an Irish-American family that settled in Britain early in the twentieth century. He has spent much of his adult life rediscovering his lost continent and interpreting it for British television, but is now fairly content to let time and chance bounce him between a hilltop house in the English Pennines and a Manhattan apartment with frequent forays into the Chiricahua Mountains.British author Lawton's marvelously evocative series of mysteries about Det. Sgt. Freddie Troy, Anglo-Russian Londoner, have been written and/or published in such a confusing order that it's hard to determine where this one, originally published in the U.K. in 2004 as <i>Blue Rondo</i> - comes in the canon. Characters introduced in 2004's <i>Bluffing Mr. Churchill</i>, including Winston's distant cousin Bob Churchill, an ace gunsmith, play an important role here, as 29-year-old Troy, who's recovering from serious gunshot wounds, celebrates Christmas 1944 by taking shooting lessons from Bob. Troy's Russian aristocrat father�&#x20ac;"turned�&#x20ac;"British newspaper publisher has died; his mother's health is failing; his twin sisters seem to be intent on spreading their sexual favors around like caviar while their husbands are at the front. Then we jump ahead to the late 1950s, when London is becoming a mecca for American gamblers. Troy's old lover, the delightful ex-cop Kitty Stilton, returns to London as the wife of an important American politician with JFK overtones. There are characters based on (or at least inspired by) everyone from Frank Sinatra to Meyer Lansky, enough dismembered bodies to satisfy the most morbid imaginations and frequent flashes of sly wit and social conscience that illuminate a vanished world. Lawton's Troy series cries out to be made available with some kind of time line in order to give it, like Philip Kerr's Berlin Noir trilogy or the Jean-Louis St.<br><i>Cyr/Hermann Kohler books by J.

The Directorate&#x2019;s cleanup team had done a good job of removing the evidence.<br><br>Bile rose up my throat, and I briefly closed my eyes. I&#x2019;d seen her&#x2014;�had seen what had been done to her&#x2014;�and it haunted me every night in my dreams. But in many ways, those dreams were also responsible for me finally being able to walk through the front door today.<br><br>I&#x2019;d done enough remembering, and shed enough tears. Now I wanted revenge, and that wasn&#x2019;t going to happen if I waited for others to hunt down the killers. No, I needed to be a part of it. I needed to do something to help ease the ferocity of the dreams&#x2014;�dreams that came from the guilty knowledge that I should have been there for her. That if I had, I might have been able to prevent this.<br><br>I drew in a deep breath that did little to steady the almost automatic wash of fury, and discovered something else. Her scent still lingered.<br><br>And not just her scent. Everything she&#x2019;d been, and everything she&#x2019;d done&#x2014;�all her love and energy and compassion&#x2014;�filled this place with a warmth that still radiated from the very walls.<br><br>For the first time since I&#x2019;d scattered her ashes in the hills that she&#x2019;d loved, I smiled.<br><br>She would never entirely be gone from this world. She&#x2019;d done too much, and helped too many people, for her memory to be erased completely.<br><br>And that was one hell of a legacy.<br><br>Still, despite the echoes of the warmth and love that had once filled these rooms, I had no intention of keeping the house. Not when all I had to do was step into the kitchen to be reminded of everything that had happened.<br><br>I walked along the hallway, my boots echoing on the polished marble floor. Aside from the few items of furniture placed to give prospective buyers an idea of each room&#x2019;s size and purpose, the house was empty. Mike&#x2014;�who&#x2019;d been Mom&#x2019;s financial adviser and was still mine&#x2014;�had made all the arrangements, talking to the real estate people on my behalf and shifting most of the furniture into storage so I could deal with it later. Only the items in the two safes remained untouched, and that was a task only I could handle&#x2014;�although it was the one thing I&#x2019;d been avoiding until now.<br><br>I drew in a shuddery breath, then slowly climbed the carpeted stairs. Once I reached the landing, I headed for Mom&#x2019;s bedroom down at the far end of the hall. The air had a disused smell. Maybe the people employed to keep the house spotless until it sold hadn&#x2019;t been as generous with the deodorizer up here.<br><br>But the soft hint of oranges and sunshine teased my nostrils as I walked into Mom&#x2019;s bedroom, and just for a moment it felt like she was standing beside me.<br><br>Which was silly, because she&#x2019;d long since moved on, but my fingers still twitched with the urge to reach for her.<br><br>I walked across the thick carpet and opened the double doors to her wardrobe. Her clothes had already been donated to charity, but somehow seeing this emptiness hit me in a way that the emptiness of the other rooms had not. I&#x2019;d often played in here as a kid, dressing up in her silkiest gowns and smear- ing my face&#x2014;�and no doubt said gowns&#x2014;�with her makeup.<br><br>She&#x2019;d never once been angry. She&#x2019;d always laughed and joined the fun, even letting me do her face.<br><br>I swiped at the tear that appeared on my cheek and resolutely walked into the bathroom. Most people wouldn&#x2019;t think of looking for a safe in an en suite, which is exactly why Mom had installed her second one here. This was where she&#x2019;d stored her most precious jewelry.<br><br>I opened the double doors under the basin and ducked down. The safe was embedded in the wall and visible only because all of Mom&#x2019;s makeup had been cleared away.<br><br>After typing in the code, I pressed my hand against the reader. Red light flickered across my fingertips; then there was a soft click as the safe opened.<br><br>I took a deep breath, then sat and pulled the door all the way open. Inside were all her favorite items, including the chunky jade bracelet she&#x2019;d bought the last time she was in New Zealand, only a few weeks before her death. There was also a stack of microdrive photo disks and, finally, an envelope.<br><br>There was nothing written on the front of the envelope, but faint wisps of orange teased my nostrils as I flipped it over and slid a nail along the edge to open it. Inside was a folded piece of paper that smelled of Mom. I took another, somewhat shaky breath and opened it.<br><br>I&#x2019;m sorry that I had to leave you in the dark, my darling daughter, it said, and I could almost imagine her saying the words as I read them. Could almost feel her warm breath stirring the hair near my cheek. But I was given little other choice. Besides, I saw my death long ago and knew it was the price I had to pay for having you. I never regretted my choice&#x2014;�not then, and most certainly not now, when that death is at my doorstep. Don&#x2019;t ever think I accepted my fate placidly. I didn&#x2019;t. But the cosmos could show me no way out that didn&#x2019;t also involve your death or Riley&#x2019;s. Or worse, both of you. In the end, it just had to be.<br><br>Live long, love well, and I will see you in the next life. I love you always. Mom.<br><br>I closed my eyes against the sting of tears. Damn it, I wouldn&#x2019;t cry again. I wouldn&#x2019;t.<br><br>But my tear ducts weren&#x2019;t taking any notice.<br><br>I swiped at the moisture, then sat back on my heels. Oddly enough, I almost felt better. At least now I knew why she&#x2019;d refused to tell me what was going on. She&#x2019;d seen my death&#x2014;�and Riley&#x2019;s&#x2014;�if we&#x2019;d intervened. And I would have intervened. I mean, she was my mother.<br><br>And as a result, I&#x2019;d have died.<br><br>Her death still hurt&#x2014;�would always hurt&#x2014;�but a tiny weight seemed to have lifted from my soul.<br><br>I glanced down at the letter in my hand, smiling slightly as her scent spun around me, then folded it up again and tucked it into my pocket. That one piece of paper was worth more than anything else in her safe.<br><br>I scooped up the remainder of the jewels, but as I rose, awareness washed over me. Someone&#x2014;�or something&#x2014;�was in the house.<br><br>I was half werewolf, and my senses were keen. Though I hadn&#x2019;t actually locked the front door, I doubted any humans could have entered without me hearing. Humans tended to walk heavily, even when they were trying to sneak, and with the house almost empty the sound would have echoed. But this invader was as silent as a ghost. And it wasn&#x2019;t nonhuman, either, because in the midst of awareness came a wash of heat&#x2014;�not body heat, but rather the heat of a powerful presence.<br><br>An Aedh.<br><br>And he was in spirit form rather than physical.<br><br>My pulse skipped, then raced. The last time I&#x2019;d felt something like this, I&#x2019;d been in the presence of my father. Of course, that meeting had ended when two Aedh priests had gate-�crashed the party in an effort to capture my father&#x2014;�who&#x2019;d fled and left me to fight the priests off alone. Needless to say, the odds had been on their side, and I&#x2019;d been taken and tortured for information. And while my father might not have led me into the trap, he still bore some responsibility for it. It was him they wanted, not me.<br><br>Hell, everyone wanted him. The Directorate of Other Races, the vampire council, and the reapers.<br><br>And they all were intent on using me to get to him.<br><br>Which pissed me off no end, but there wasn&#x2019;t a whole lot I could do about it. Especially given the deal I&#x2019;d made with Madeline Hunter&#x2014;�the woman who was not only in charge of the Directorate, but also one of the highest-�ranking members of the vampire council. Of course, she had managed to catch me at a vulnerable moment. She&#x2019;d arrived uninvited as I said my final good-�bye to Mom, had heard my vow for vengeance, and had all but blackmailed me into becoming an adviser to the council. In exchange, they would throw their full resources behind finding Mom&#x2019;s killer.<br><br>I hadn&#x2019;t walked away from the deal yet&#x2014;�not when finding Mom&#x2019;s killer might well depend on the information the council could give me. They might be using me to get to my dad, but I sure as hell intended to return the favor.<br><br>Not that they&#x2019;d given me a whole lot so far, but then I hadn&#x2019;t done a whole lot for them, either.<br><br>Still, instinct said that would change quickly now that I&#x2019;d set my sights on finding the killer.<br><br>Sometimes, having psychic skills like my mom totally sucked. Although I guess I had to be thankful that mine were nowhere near as strong as hers had been.<br><br>The sensation of power coming up from the floor below was growing stronger. Whoever it was, they were closing in fast. I needed help, and I needed it now. And the only person I could call on so quickly was the one person I was trying to avoid. Azriel&#x2014;�the reaper who was linked to my Chi. I hadn&#x2019;t heard or seen him since Mom&#x2019;s death, and part of me had been hoping to keep it that way.<br><br>I should have known fate would have other ideas.<br><br>Of course, Azriel wasn&#x2019;t just a reaper. He was a Mijai, a dark angel who hunted and killed the things that returned from the depths of hell&#x2014;�or the dark path, as the reapers preferred to call it&#x2014;�to steal from this world.<br><br>But what he hunted now wasn&#x2019;t a soul-�stealer or even my soul.<br><br>He&#x2014;�like everyone else&#x2014;�was looking for my father.<br><br>And all because my father and his fellow Raziq&#x2014;� a secret subgroup of Aedh priests dedicated to finding a way of preventing demons from being summoned&#x2014;�had created three keys that would override the magic controlling the gates, allowing them to be permanently closed. And if the gates of hell were permanently locked, no souls would be able to move on and be reborn. A good percentage of the babies currently born into this world contained reborn souls, so it was a possibility that terrified me. Because without a soul, they would be little more than lumps of flesh, incapable of thought, emotion, or feeling.<br><br>Of course, what could be closed could also be permanently opened, and I had no doubt there were those who would also welcome the hordes of hell being set free.<br><br>The one good thing that had come out of this mess so far was the fact that my father had apparently come to his senses late in the development of the keys. He&#x2019;d arranged for them to be stolen and hidden, but he&#x2019;d been caught in the process and punished by his fellow Raziq, and the people who&#x2019;d hidden the keys had offed themselves before they could tell anyone where they were.<br><br>Hence everyone&#x2019;s interest in me. I was currently the only link to my father and&#x2014;�according to my father&#x2014;�the only person capable of not only finding the keys, but also destroying them.<br><br>Although he had yet to explain just how.<br><br>Azriel, I thought silently, not wanting to alert whoever was approaching that I was calling for help. I knew from past experience that Azriel could hear thoughts as well as spoken words. If you&#x2019;re out there, come fast. There&#x2019;s an Aedh in the house and it could be my father.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t answer; nor did the heat of his presence sting the air. Either he had given up following me or something else was going on.<br><br>Which was typical. There was never a fucking reaper around when you wanted one. I took a deep breath that did little to calm the sudden flare of nerves, and said, &#x201c;Whoever you are, reveal yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That, as I have said before, is impossible, as I can no longer attain flesh.&#x201d; The reply was measured, cultured, and very familiar.<br><br>Because it sounded like me. A male version of me.<br><br>My father.<br><br>&#x201c;The last time you and I met, the Raziq came running. And that was your fault, by the way, not mine.&#x201d; I crossed my arms and leaned back against the wall. The pose might appear casual, but every muscle quivered, ready to launch into action should the need arise. Not that I&#x2019;d have any hope against a full Aedh&#x2014;�I knew that from experience.<br><br>&#x201c;I have taken precautions this time.&#x201d; His cultured tones reverberated around the small room, and his presence&#x2014;�or rather the energy of it&#x2014;�was almost smothering. &#x201c;They will not sense me in this house just yet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not? What have you done this time that&#x2019;s any different?&#x201d;<br><br>He paused, as if considering his reply. &#x201c;Because I was once a priest, I emit a certain type of energy. If I remain stationary for too long, they can trace me.&#x201d;<br><br>Facts I knew, thanks to Azriel. &#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t answer my question.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wards have been set. They not only give misinformation as to my whereabouts, but they will prevent any beings such as myself from entering.&#x201d;<br><br>Hence Azriel&#x2019;s failure to appear. Reapers were energy beings, the same as the Aedh.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t bother asking how&#x2019;d he&#x2019;d actually set the wards when he couldn&#x2019;t interact with this world, simply because he&#x2019;d undoubtedly had his slaves do it. Or rather, his Razan, as the Aedh tended to call them. &#x201c;And are you sure these wards will work?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. I have no wish for you to be captured a second time.&#x201d;<br><br>So he knew about that&#x2014;�and it meant he was keeping a closer eye on me than I&#x2019;d assumed. &#x201c;So why are you here? What do you want?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I want what I have always wanted&#x2014;�for you to find the keys.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And destroy them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That goes without saying.&#x201d;<br><br>Did it? I really wasn&#x2019;t so sure. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t yet told me what will happen when the keys are destroyed, and I&#x2019;d prefer to know that before I do anything rash.&#x201d; Like endanger the very fabric of my world.<br><br>The heat of him drew closer. It spun around me&#x2014;�an almost threatening presence that made my skin crawl. And it wasn&#x2019;t just the sheer sense of power he was exuding, but the lack of any sense of humanity. This was a being who&#x2019;d worn flesh rarely even when he was capable of it, and who had no love or understanding for those of us who did.<br><br>Which made his desire to find and destroy the keys even more puzzling. Why would he care what would happen to this world if the keys were used? He wouldn&#x2019;t. Which meant something else was going on. Something he wasn&#x2019;t telling me.<br><br>Although I wasn&#x2019;t surprised that he was keeping secrets. That seemed to be par for the course for everyone searching for these damn keys.<br><br>&#x201c;I am sure that when the keys are destroyed, everything will remain as it currently is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But aren&#x2019;t the keys now tuned to the power of the gates?&#x201d;<br><br>Or the portals, as the reapers preferred to call them. Apparently there was only one gate into heaven or hell, with each gate consisting of three interlocked portals. Each portal had to be locked behind a soul before the next one opened. It was a system that prevented those in hell from escaping&#x2014;�although it wasn&#x2019;t infallible. Things still escaped when enough magic was used either in this world or the other.<br><br>&#x201c;They are,&#x201d; my father said. &#x201c;Destroying them should sever the link, and the gates should remain intact.&#x201d;<br><br>It was those shoulds that were worrying me. &#x201c;You know,&#x201d; I said slowly, &#x201c;it seems that it would be a whole lot safer for everyone if these keys were to remain as they are&#x2014;�indefinitely hidden.&#x201d;<br><br>Energy surged, making the hairs along my arms and the back of my neck rise. &#x201c;Do you honestly think the Raziq will let matters lie?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Honestly? No. But they can&#x2019;t kill me if they need me to find the keys.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then what about your friends? Such a move could place them in peril.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not if I let the Raziq grab me. Once they realize I can&#x2019;t help them, I&#x2019;m guessing they&#x2019;ll forget me and start concentrating on you again.&#x201d; After all, he might not know where the keys actually were, but he had some general knowledge of where they&#x2019;d been sent, and he knew what they&#x2019;d been disguised as.<br><br>Although...</p><h2>The 100-Day Ngondro Retreat: Based on the Longchen Nyingtik and The Words of My Perfect Teacher</h2><p>The ngondro or preliminary practices of Vajrayana Buddhism help you set your intention and commitment to fully follow these teachings. There are several approaches that have been taught. The primary approach involves 500,000 repetitions with at least 100,000 prostrations and other supporting actions. This can be viewed as a massive undertaking by Western practitioners with jobs, families, etc. It can take several years to complete these, and we tend to be impatient!Some masters have given alternative instructions on how to complete these requirements, while still showing to the Lama your commitment and dedication in preparing for the more advanced practices. Among these instructions is doing a 100-day contemplative retreat. This is the practice described in this book, based on the Longchen Nyingtik. It is also a supporting commentary (&#x201c;son&#x201d; text) to the widely respected text, The Words of My Perfect Teacher by Patrul Rinpoche, which is cross referenced throughout the book. Here, specific contemplations are assigned each day, some being repeated for up to three days for a total of 100 days. It need not be done for full days, such as the traditional four sessions during each day format. But twice each day &#x201c;as much as you can&#x201d; is recommended.

Their legacy is interwoven with the state&#39;s history and culture even as they continue to struggle with prejudice, environmental pressures, shrinking state revenues, the effects of globalization, and the changing dynamics of the state economy. Current U.S. immigration policy and the forces of globalization have played a critical role in creating a dynamic process named the &#39;browning of Oregon.&#39; This anthology brings together a group of noted multidisciplinary scholars, who explore the rich and varied experiences of Oregon&#39;s native communities and racial minorities. Anchored in a &#39;power relations&#39; perspective, the book has been organized around several key historical themes, including: the foundation of ethnic communities; civil rights; social justice; ethnicity and labor; and various forms of cultural traditions. As disparate as they seem in style and topic, this collection of essays highlight the distinctive experiences of Oregon&#39;s people of color and communicates the broader interlocking categories of social identity. The book is essential reading for students, teachers, and the general public interested in contemporary racial politics.</p><p><b>Jun Xing</b> is Professor of Ethnic Studies at Oregon State University.

Croy grounds his treatment of exegetical practices on the theological nature of Scripture and on the sort of faithful interpreter who can best render a sacred text for today's world. Each section concludes with excellent annotated bibliographies of resources and teacher-friendly exercises that will make this book useful for the classroom."--<b>Robert Walter Wall</b>, Seattle Pacific University<br><br>"This book equips Christian ministry students for mature and critical engagement of author-centered, text-centered, and reader-centered interpretative theories, warning against facile or faddish escape into one or another extreme. Croy provides a clear and sufficient guide to the art of asking good questions of the biblical text and of finding reliable answers, laying a solid foundation for the practice of a wide range of exegetical skills and the development of a sound hermeneutical model. His driving interest is to equip students to interpret Scripture in order to practice its truth in every sphere of life--from the personal to the political, from the individual to the international--fulfilling Johannes Bengel's vision for biblical interpretation: apply yourself fully to the text, and apply the text fully to yourself. I look forward to using it in my own classroom."--<b>David A. deSilva</b>, Ashland Theological Seminary<br><br>"<i>Prima Scriptura</i> does not stop with its crystal clear, step-by-step instruction; it also guides the reader into informed reflection on the hermeneutical issues that all interpreters face.

Yet Jewish women have always prayed and, before prayer became standardized into a formal liturgy, Israelite women offered up spontaneous petitions and hymns to God as freely as did men. While they may not have been able to help constitute a minyan, and while many did not know Hebrew or Aramaic, women produced and used material for prayer at home.<br> The Yiddish tkhines had its origin in a form of supplicatory prayer in the Talmud, whose original intent was to allow for individual private devotion during the standard prayer service. The private Yiddish prayers and devotions for Jewish women continued to use this term. They emerged in the world of premodern Ashkenazic Jewry and represent one of the richest and least-known forms of Jewish religious literature. Because modern sensibility seemed to reject them, and because Yiddish was quickly forgotten by second and third generation Jews in the West, they have been sadly neglected. Although a few have been individually translated into English, this is the first bilingual anthology ever to appear.<br> The prayers in this volume are characterized by a highly personal and intimate style and mark occasions in the religious calendar, such as the Tkhine for the Blessing of the New Moon, as well as occasions in the life of a woman, such as the Tkhine for a Mother who Leads Her Child to Kheyder for the First Time. The tkhines are of great appeal and value to those who wish to hear the voices of Jewish women in history, study Yiddish literature and culture, or create new expressions of spirituality.</p><p>Text: English, Yiddish</p><h2>A Natural History Guide: Great Smoky Mountains National Park</h2><p>The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is one of America's most beautiful and popular national parks.&nbsp; Located in the southern Appalachian Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina, it is home to more than 100,000 species of plants and animals.<br><br>The grandeur and sheer scale of the park has been captured in Donald W.

Winston Churchill governed Britain from his during World War II. Travelers routinely used to bed down with complete strangers, and whole families shared beds in many preindustrial households. Beds were expensive items&#x2014;and often for show. Tutankhamun was buried on a golden bed, wealthy Greeks were sent to the afterlife on dining beds, and deceased middle-class Victorians were propped up on a bed in the parlor.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this sweeping social history that covers the past seventy thousand years, Brian Fagan and Nadia Durrani look at the endlessly varied role of the bed through time. This was a place for sex, death, childbirth, storytelling, and sociability as well as sleeping. But who did what with whom, why, and how could vary incredibly depending on the time and place. It is only in the modern era that the bed has transformed into a private, hidden zone, and its rich social history has largely been forgotten.</p><p><b>Brian Fagan</b> is one of the world&#x2019;s leading archaeological writers and an internationally recognized authority on world prehistory.

Pierce, and Barbara Laslett argue that personal narratives&#x2015;autobiographies, oral histories, life history interviews, and memoirs&#x2015;are an important research tool for understanding the relationship between people and their societies. Gathering examples from throughout the world and from premodern as well as contemporary cultures, they draw from labor history and class analysis, feminist sociology, race relations, and anthropology to demonstrate the value of personal narratives for scholars and students alike. </p><p><i>Telling Stories</i> explores why and how personal narratives should be used as evidence, and the methods and pitfalls of their use. The authors stress the importance of recognizing that stories that people tell about their lives are never simply individual. Rather, they are told in historically specific times and settings and call on rules, models, and social experiences that govern how story elements link together in the process of self-narration. Stories show how individuals' motivations, emotions, and imaginations have been shaped by their cumulative life experiences. In turn, <i>Telling Stories</i> demonstrates how the knowledge produced by personal narrative analysis is not simply contained in the stories told; the understanding that takes place between narrator and analyst and between analyst and audience enriches the results immeasurably.</p></p><p>"Each of these authors brings a wealth of insight and experience to this discussion of the distinctively illuminating arguments that can be drawn from personal narrative materials. Theoretically sophisticated and grounded in an intriguing array of empirical works, Telling Stories will be an indispensable resource for those interested in any variety of life-story research."--Marjorie DeVault, Syracuse University, author of Liberating Method: Feminism and Social Research <p>"Telling Stories is an invaluable guide to making sense of personal narratives across two key disciplines: social science and history. This clear, thoughtful, and comprehensive guide to key issues and their interpretation--questions on agency, subjectivity, intersubjectivity, the complexity of narrative genres--is essential reading as we work to comprehend this key source in the production of knowledge."--Faye Ginsburg, David B. Kriser Professor of Anthropology, Director, Graduate Program in Culture and Media, and Director, Center for Media, Culture &amp; History, New York University </p><p>"Telling Stories provides an instructive and usable map of approaches to working with personal narratives. The authors' careful readings of a number of key texts are clear and graceful."-Michael Frisch, University at Buffalo, SUNY </p><p>"Telling Stories supports the value of the narrative turn and offers well-grounded advice to would-be narrative historians."-Arthur W. Frank, University of Calgary</p><p>Mary Jo Maynes is Professor of History at the University of Minnesota.

Each calligraphy represents a term from the martial arts&#x2014;such as <i>do,</i> the way, or <i>wa, </i>harmony. The accompanying text amplifies our understanding of the term, what it meant to Japanese warriors, and what it means to practitioners of calligraphy and the martial arts today. What becomes clear is that these two seemingly unrelated disciplines actually partake of the same profound elemental spirit.</p><p><p>Dave Lowry is an accomplished martial artist, calligrapher, and writer. He is the restaurant critic for <i>St. Louis Magazine</i> and writes regularly for a number of magazines on a wide variety of subjects, many of them related to Japan and the Japanese martial arts.

A hard-drinking wild man of literature and a stubborn outsider to the poetry world, he has struck a chord with generations of readers, writing raw, tough poetry about booze, work, and women in an authentic voice that is, like the work of the Beats, iconoclastic and even dangerous. </p> <p> Edited by his longtime publisher, John Martin, of Black Sparrow Press, and now in paperback, <i>The Continual Condition</i> includes more of this legend�s never-before-collected poems.</p></p><p><p><strong>Charles Bukowski</strong>&nbsp;is one of America&#x2019;s best-known contemporary writers of poetry and prose and, many would claim, its most influential and imitated poet. He was born in 1920 in Andernach, Germany, to an American soldier father and a German mother, and brought to the United States at the age of two. He was raised in Los Angeles and lived there for over fifty years.

He is the author of&nbsp;<em>Charles Bukowski, King of the Underground</em>, and the editor of the Bukowski collections&nbsp;<em>On Writing</em>,&nbsp;<em>On Cats</em>, and&nbsp;<em>On Love</em>.</p>Sex, self-disgust, horse racing, literary fame and obscurity, delight in foul language (dry and ridiculous bungholes), and fleeting but genuine pleasures (from voyeurism to eating a spider crab): Bukowski's many, many remaining fans will find familiar themes in this 12th set of previously unpublished poems to appear since the Los Angeles writer died in 1994. The god-damned editors don't know anything, he tells the lady on the couch, and indeed he insists on the life, the meat, of the poems. Short lines dominate this particular cull of verse, with plenty of quoted conversation mixed in; as with most of his work, misanthropy rules, making the flashes of mercy&#x2014;and of sexual acceptance&#x2014;shine bright indeed: I was/ sick and I/ turned to look out the/ window/ white yellow grease of/ morning/ burning my/ eyes./ Next to me in bed/ there she was. The poems may repeat themselves, but they stay true to Bukowski. Few people would want to trade places with this poet for whom pain sits, pain floats, pain/ waits;/ pain is, but plenty will continue to cherish his unpretentious words. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His anti-colonialist, philosophical and revolutionary writings were among the most influential of the twentieth century. The political essays, articles and notes published in <i>Alienation and Freedom: The Political Writings </i>cover the most active period of his life, from the publication of <i>White Skin, Black Masks </i>in 1952 &#x2013; when he was twenty-eight years old &#x2013; to that of <i>The Wretched of the Earth</i>, the appearance of which in 1961 coincided, give or take a few days, with the date of his death from leukaemia at the age of thirty-six.<br>These political writings represent the sheer breadth and diversity of Fanon's work and this volume is original in that it contains his earliest works to survive, the plays <i>The Drowning Eye</i> and <i>Parallel Hands, </i>which expose an early preoccupation with identity and socio-political consciousness. His writings from Algeria are the most politicised however and are notable for their inflection with Fanon's support for the country's fight against French colonial rule. Indeed, as his role in treating both French and Algerian soldiers grew evermore untenable, his words became more impassioned and represent his decision to cast off his assimilationist upbringing and dedicate himself to revolution. The insights these works provide give a new depth and complexity to our understanding of Fanon's entire oeuvre and reveal how his powerful thinking about race, identity and activism remain pertinent to modern society. Shedding new light on the work of a major twentieth-century philosopher, this disruptive and moving work will shape how we look at the world.</p></p><p><p><b>Frantz Fanon </b>(1925-1961) was a Martinique-born psychiatrist, philosopher, revolutionary, and writer.

Yet original sin is now a problematic notion for many - in the &#39;dogma&#39; of modernity, nature and freedom are separated. Raymund Schwager explores how, if approached in an interdisciplinary way, and understood at the profound levels of human experience and thought that they represent, evolutionary theory and the doctrine of original sin need not contradict each other. Original sin, which ostensibly confuses separate realms in a mythological way, may preserve a deeper and critical view of what the &#39;dogma&#39; of modernity has on the surface artificially separated. Looking at current developments in genetic technology, based on the concept of the organism as a living memory, he observes the experience of suffering and evil in the contexts of natural and human history, and of revelation history. The Christian message of the drama of salvation provides the context for this dynamic exploration of the fundamental issues for human self-reflection and for theological enquiry. English language publication of this, the final work of Raymund Schwager, one of the key exponents of the ideas of Ren� Girard, has been eagerly awaited. Raymund Schwager was Professor of Theology at the University of Innsbruck, Austria. He died in 2004, shortly before the completion of the translation of this volume. His exciting and revolutionary work Must There Be Scapegoats: Violence and Redemption in the Bible is also co-published by Inigo Enterprises and Gracewing.</p><p>Raymund Schwager was Professor of Theology at the University of Innsbruck, Austria.</p><h2>Renaissance Vihuela &amp; Guitar in Sixteenth-century (Frank Koonce)</h2><p>Scholarly editions, which serve different purposes than performance editions, are not often designed with the modern guitarist in mind. For instance, Renaissance vihuela tablatures are usually transcribed with the open first string as G, not E. Most are presented in double-staff notation, a medium that is superior for realizing counterpoint but unconventional as guitar notation. Furthermore, these editions sometimes give idealized, but not realistic, solutions for voicing, note duration, and other matters that need to be considered within the limitations of our instrument. Guitarists who try to play from these editions essentially are faced with the task of transcribing the transcription! This 188-page anthology is designed as a companion volume to The Baroque Guitar in Spain and the New World (MB21122). It includes representative selections, edited for modern guitar, from the seven books for vihuela that were published in Spain between 1536 and 1576.As well as being fun and entertaining music for all to enjoy, these collections are intended to help bridge the gap between scholarly editions and performance editions by providing a hands-on introduction to tablature transcription and to issues concerning historically informed performance of early music on the guitar.</p><p>Frank Koonce is internationally acclaimed as a performer, teacher, and writer. He holds degrees from the North Carolina School of the Arts and from Southern Methodist University, studying first with Jes�s Silva and then with Robert Guthrie. In 1974-75, he was a Fulbright Scholar and performer in Italy where he studied with Sergio Notaro and Alirio Diaz. Mr. Koonce&#39;s creative output includes an authoritative guitar edition of Johann Sebastian Bach&#39;s complete solo lute works and recordings with both English and Spanish narration of Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco&#39;s Platero y yo. He has also recorded an album entitled A Southwest Christmas with the Phoenix Bach Choir and is featured in a live concert video with the renowned composer/guitarist, Nikita Koshkin (Mel Bay 99231VX). As a founding partner of Soundset Recordings he has helped produce other classical compact discs, including a premiere recording of works by Alan Hovhaness with the Korean Broadcasting System Symphony Orchestra and the first two recordings of Nikita Koshkin. A Professor of Music, Frank Koonce has directed the guitar program at Arizona State University since 1978.

Here James Resseguie applies the easily understandable tools introduced in his primer on narrative criticism to this challenging book. He shows how Revelation uses such features as rhetoric, setting, character, point of view, plot, symbolism, style, and repertoire to construct its meaning. This literary approach draws out the theological and homiletical message of the book and highlights its major unifying themes: the need to listen well, an overwhelmingly Godcentered perspective, and the exodus to a new promised land. Here is a valuable aid for pastor and serious lay reader alike.</p><p>"Resseguie's 'narrative commentary' on the book of Revelation helps the reader follow in the footsteps of John the narrator. The author allows us to hear what John heard and see what John saw, so that the sights and sounds of the book mutually interpret and enrich one another. In his hands, this last book of the Christian Bible becomes neither a coded account of first-century Roman politics nor a timetable of future events, but a story in its own right, a story of judgment and redemption to be heard afresh in every generation, not least our own. Highly recommended."--<b>J. Ramsey Michaels</b>, Missouri State University, Springfield<br><br>"With great skill, Resseguie presents a unified reading of John's Apocalypse as seen through the lens of narrative criticism in the grand tradition of Northrop Frye. The book provides not only careful discussion of major literary concerns but also a close reading of the text from beginning to end, a reading in constant dialogue with a wide range of scholars. This is a welcome addition to the growing body of work analyzing the Apocalypse as a narrative, and whether you find yourself agreeing or disagreeing on specific points, you will find a stimulating and well-argued commentary."--<b>David L. Barr</b>, Wright State University<br><br>"Resseguie invites us to enter the story world of Revelation and to explore it from within. While remaining fully attentive to historical and linguistic concerns, he also exposes the book's literary features. Anyone who wants to understand the book of Revelation will find this book helpful, but be forewarned: you may come to regard 'understanding' as a minimal goal. This is a commentary that moves beyond intellectual understanding to profound appreciation of a classic, literary work of art."--<b>Mark Allan Powell</b>, Trinity Lutheran Seminary<br><br>"In addition to being nicely illustrated and very readable, this book brings the advantage of careful attention to John's story. Where many commentators read the text of Revelation as though they know the story in advance, Resseguie leaves the author's story in control. This commentary is a breed apart."<br>--<b>Sigve Tonstad</b>, Loma Linda University<br><br>"Resseguie's narrative commentary invites contemporary readers to venture into Revelation's literary world and to sense the transformative power of its text. Written in a clear and accessible style, this study helps readers see Revelation as a whole, guiding them through its scenes of cosmic conflict and into the New Jerusalem."--<b>Craig R.

At the other end of the lifespan, John Updike&#x2019;s &#x201c;My Father&#x2019;s Tears,&#x201d; Jim Shepard&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Mortality of Parents,&#x201d; and William Maxwell&#x2019;s &#x201c;The man who lost his father&#x201d; bring us face to face with a loss that is like no other. <br> In between, we encounter a full range of emotions connecting men and their offspring:&nbsp; tenderness and devotion, anxiety and incomprehension, admiration and regret. Powerful patriarchs cast a long shadow in Katherine Mansfield&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Daughters of the Late Colonel&#x201d; and D. H. Lawrence&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Christening,&#x201d; while Edith Wharton&#x2019;s &#x201c;His Father&#x2019;s Son&#x201d; sheds a more ironic light on the paternal legacy. E. L. Doctorow&#x2019;s young protagonist, forced to write letters impersonating his dead father, arrives at a deeper understanding of him, while in Helen Simpson&#x2019;s &#x201c;Sorry?&#x201d; an old man&#x2019;s hearing aid seems to reveal what his children secretly think about him. Paternal bonds are forged outside biology, too: Graham Swift portrays a man wistfully seeking a substitute son, while Guy de Maupassant&#x2019;s forlorn waif triumphantly acquires an ideal father. In these twenty stories, an array of great writers&#x2014;ranging from Kafka, Joyce, and Nabokov to Raymond Carver, Harold Brodkey, and Andre Dubus&#x2014;offers a wonderfully varied assortment of fictional takes on paternity.</p><p><b>Diana Secker Tesdell</b> is the editor of the Everyman's Pocket Classic anthologies <i>Christmas Stories,</i> <i>Love Stories, Dog Stories, Cat Stories, Horse Stories</i>, <i>New York Stories</i>, <i>Bedtime Stories, Stories of Art and Artists, Stories of Fatherhood</i>, <i>Stories of Motherhood,&nbsp;Stories of the Sea</i>,&nbsp;and <i>Stories from the Kitchen, </i>and of&nbsp;the Everyman's Library Pocket Poet <i>Lullabies and Poems for Children.</i><i>Excerpted from</i> Simon&#x2019;s Father <i><br> By Guy de Maupassant, translated by Ernest Boyd</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Noon had just struck. The school-door opened and the youngsters streamed out tumbling over one another in their haste to get out quickly. But instead of promptly dispersing and going home to dinner as was their daily wont, they stopped a few paces off, broke up into knots and set to whispering.<br> &nbsp;<br> The fact was that that morning Simon, the son of La Blanchotte, had, for the first time, attended school. They had all of them in their families heard of La Blanchotte; and although in public she was welcome enough, the mothers among themselves treated her with compassion of a somewhat disdainful kind, which the children had caught without in the least knowing why.<br> &nbsp;<br> As for Simon himself, they did not know him, for he never went abroad, and did not play around with them through&nbsp; the streets of the village or along the banks of the river. So they did not like him much, and it was with a certain delight, mingled with astonishment, that they gathered in groups this morning, repeating to each other this phrase pronounced by a lad of fourteen or fifteen who appeared to know all about it, so sagaciously did he wink: &#x2018;You know Simon &#x2013; well, he has no father.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> La Blanchotte&#x2019;s son appeared in his turn upon the threshold of the school.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was seven or eight years old, rather pale, very neat, with a timid and almost awkward manner.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was making his way back to his mother&#x2019;s house when the various groups of his schoolfellows, perpetually whispering, and watching him with the mischievous and heartless eyes of children bent upon playing a nasty trick, gradually surrounded him and ended by enclosing him altogether. There he stood amongst them, surprised and embarrassed, not understanding what they were going to do to him. But the lad who had brought the news, puffed up with the success he had met with, demanded:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;What is your name?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> He answered: &#x2018;Simon.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Simon what?&#x2019; retorted the other.<br> &nbsp;<br> The child, altogether bewildered, repeated: &#x2018;Simon.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> The lad shouted at him: &#x2018;You must be named Simon something! That is not a name &#x2013; Simon indeed!&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> And he, on the brink of tears, replied for the third time:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;My name is Simon.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> The urchins began laughing. The lad triumphantly lifted up his voice: &#x2018;You can see plainly that he has no father.&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;<br> A deep silence ensued. The children were dumbfounded by this extraordinary, impossibly monstrous thing &#x2013; a boy who had no father; they looked upon him as a phenomenon, an unnatural being, and they felt rising in them the hitherto inexplicable pity of their mothers for La Blanchotte. As for Simon, he had propped himself against a tree to avoid falling, and he stood there as if paralysed by an irreparable disaster. He sought to explain, but he could think of no answer for them, no way to deny this horrible charge that he had no father. At last he shouted at them quite recklessly:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Yes, I have one.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Where is he?&#x2019; demanded the boy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Simon was silent, he did not know. The children shrieked, tremendously excited. These sons of the soil, more animal than human, experienced the cruel craving which makes the fowls of a farmyard destroy one of their own kind as soon as it is wounded. Simon suddenly spied a little neighbour, the son of a widow, whom he had always seen, as he himself was to be seen, quite alone with his mother.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;And no more have you,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;no more have you a father.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; replied the other, &#x2018;I have one.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Where is he?&#x2019; rejoined Simon.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;He is dead,&#x2019; declared the brat with superb dignity, &#x2018;he is in the cemetery, is my father.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> A murmur of approval rose amid the scapegraces, as if the fact of possessing a father dead in a cemetery made their comrade big enough to crush the other one who had no father at all. And these rogues, whose fathers were for the most part evil-doers, drunkards, thieves, and harsh with their wives, hustled each other as they pressed closer and closer to Simon as though they, the legitimate ones, would stifle in their pressure one who was beyond the law. <br> &nbsp;<br> The lad next to Simon suddenly put his tongue out at him with a waggish air and shouted at him:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;No father! No father!&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Simon seized him by the hair with both hands and set to work to kick his legs while he bit his cheek ferociously. A tremendous struggle ensued. The two boys were separated and Simon found himself beaten, torn, bruised, rolled on the ground in the middle of the ring of applauding little vagabonds. As he arose, mechanically brushing his little blouse all covered with dust with his hand, someone shouted at him:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Go and tell your father.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> He then felt a great sinking in his heart. They were stronger than he, they had beaten him and he had no answer to give them, for he knew it was true that he had no father.<br> &nbsp;<br> Full of pride he tried for some moments to struggle against the tears which were suffocating him. He had a choking fit, and then without cries he began to weep with great sobs which shook him incessantly. Then a ferocious joy broke out among his enemies, and, just like savages in fearful festivals, they took one another by the hand and danced in a circle about him as they repeated in refrain:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;No father! No father!&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> But suddenly Simon ceased sobbing. Frenzy overtook him. There were stones under his feet; he picked them up and with all his strength hurled them at his tormentors. Two or three were struck and ran away yelling, and so formidable did he appear that the rest became panic-stricken. Cowards, like a jeering crowd in the presence of an exasperated man, they broke up and fled. Left alone, the little thing without a father set off running toward the fields, for a recollection had been awakened which nerved his soul to a great determination. <br> &nbsp;<br> He made up his mind to drown himself in the river.<br> &nbsp;<br> He remembered, in fact, that eight days ago a poor devil who begged for his livelihood had thrown himself into the water because he was destitute. Simon had been there when they fished him out again; and the sight of the fellow, who had seemed to him so miserable and ugly, had then impressed him &#x2013; his pale cheeks, his long drenched beard, and his open eyes being full of calm. The bystanders had said:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;He is dead.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> And some one had added:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;He is quite happy now.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> So Simon wished to drown himself also because he had no father, just as the wretched man did who had no money. He reached the water and watched it flowing. Some fishes were rising briskly in the clear stream and occasionally made little leaps and caught the flies on the surface. He stopped crying in order to watch them, for their feeding interested him vastly. But, at intervals, as in the lulls of a tempest, when tremendous gusts of wind snap off trees and then die away, this thought would return to him with intense pain:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I am about to drown myself because I have no father.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was very warm and lovely. The pleasant sunshine warmed the grass; the water shone like a mirror; and Simon enjoyed for some minutes the happiness of that languor which follows weeping, desirous even of falling asleep there upon the grass in the warmth of noon.</p><h2>Shelburne Farms: House, Gardens, Farm, and Barns</h2><p><b>Celebrating the beauty of Vermont&#x2019;s Shelburne Farms, a National&nbsp;Historic Landmark on the shores of Lake Champlain.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> This book tells the story of Shelburne Farms, once a magnificent Gilded Age country estate conceived by America&#x2019;s leading aristocrats of the day, Lila Vanderbilt and William Seward Webb.

Upon turning thirty, she ventured to her mother's native Mexico to do some root-searching and stumbled upon a social movement that shook the nation to its core. <br> <br> <i>Mexican Enough</i> chronicles her adventures rumbling with luchadores (professional wrestlers), marching with rebel teachers in Oaxaca, investigating the murder of a prominent gay activist, and sneaking into a prison to meet with indigenous resistance fighters. She also visits families of the undocumented workers she befriended back home. Travel mates include a Polish thief, a Border Patrol agent, and a sultry dominatrix. Part memoir, part journalistic reportage, <i>Mexican Enough</i> illuminates how we cast off our identity in our youth, only to strive to find it again as adults -- and the lessons to be learned along the way.</p><p><b>Stephanie Elizondo Griest</b> has mingled with the Russian Mafiya, polished Chinese propaganda, and belly danced with Cuban rumba queens.

My lip split halfway to my ear. As a doctor stitched my cheek, I decided that motor vehicles were death machines and should be avoided. This is why I live in New York City: subways. On the rare occasion I find myself in the driver's seat, I'm haunted by visions of children darting across the road -- perhaps images of my former self. I grip the steering wheel at eleven and one o'clock, lurching and braking.</p><p>Like now. I'm sputtering down Interstate 10 in a '92 Mazda, en route from Los Angeles to my parents' house in Corpus Christi, Texas. Today is the Tucson-El Paso leg. I veer off the highway onto an isolated farm road curving along the Mexican border and wind up in a desert choked with cactus and brush. This is my ideal driving scenario: no one to hit. The air conditioner has perished, so it is hot as blazes. I roll down the windows and contemplate my thirtieth birthday, which is a month away. My twenties were consumed by my first book, a memoir about traveling around the Communist Bloc. During the decade it took to research, write, and publish it, I grew keenly aware that I was living backward, more in my past than in my present. It is time to move on, but where? To what?</p><p>When asked this on my book tour, I had a ready reply: learn Spanish. Despite being third-generation Mexican-American (on my mother's side) and growing up 150 miles from the Texas-Mexico border, my Spanish is best described as Tarzan Lite: a primitive vocabulary spoken entirely in the present tense. My mom faced so much ridicule for her accent growing up that she never taught my sister or me how to speak the language properly. I mostly picked up curse words in school (�pendejo!) and opted to learn Russian in college. Studies show that only 17 percent of third-generation Mexicans can speak Spanish fluently, but it riddles me with guilt -- especially now that I've entered the publishing world. I'm turning down invitations to speak to groups I supposedly represent because I literally can't communicate with them.</p><p>A logical life plan would be to venture across this desert and explore the land and tongue of my ancestors. Yet the very notion terrifies me. Ask any South Texan. To us, Mexico means kidnappings and shoot-outs in broad daylight in Nuevo Laredo, or the unsolved murders of young women in Ju�rez. It means narco-traffickers in every cantina and explosive diarrhea from every comedor. When I was in high school, a college student got snatched off the street while partying in Matamoros during spring break. Bound and gagged, he was driven to a ranch run by a satanic cult. Next thing you know, he was menudo. One worshipper wore a belt made of his victims' spinal cords.</p><p>So go to Mexico? Thanks, but I'd rather return to Moscow and track down my old mafiosi boyfriend.</p><p>I'm cresting a small hill now. Glistening pools of water appear on the road up ahead, then evaporate. It is dizzyingly hot. I glance down at the gas gauge. It's nearly empty. Cell phone: roaming. Not a soul has passed me on this road. If the Mazda breaks down, I'm toast. Better turn around and rejoin the main highway. My foot hovers above the brake as I grasp the clutch.</p><p>Something appears in the distance. Objects in the middle of the road. Moving sluggishly, then quickly. Bears? What kind of bear prowls around the Arizona desert? No. They must be wild dogs, big ones, standing on their hind legs and...running?</p><p>No. They are people. One figure seems to be a child. My lifelong phantom has actualized. I slam the brakes. They must be Mexicans fleeing the border. I blare the horn.</p><p>"�Agua! �Tengo agua!" I scream out the window.</p><p>They must need water. I have two bottles. I must give one to them.</p><p>But...what if water isn't all they need? What if they ask me to take them somewhere? Of course I will say yes. How can I deny a ride to people in the middle of the desert?</p><p>But what if they don't just want a lift? What if they want my car?</p><p>Or what if they take it? Toss me into the cactus and roar away? That is what I would do, if the tables were turned: throw out the gringa and go.</p><p>The irony here is immediate. Nearly every accolade I have received in life -- from minority-based scholarships to book contracts -- has been at least partly due to the genetic link I share with the people charging through the snake-infested brush. What separates us is a twist of geographical fate that birthed me on one side of the border and them on the other. They are "too Mexican." I am just enough.</p><p>The Mazda has slowed to a crawl, but the border crossers have vanished. Water shimmers where they once stood. I pause a moment, wondering what to do, then slowly begin to accelerate. As I look off into the desert hills from which they descended, a surprising thought flashes through my mind: <i>I want to go to Mexico.</i><br></p><p>By the time I've dropped off the car in Texas and flown home to Brooklyn, I've regained my senses. I can't go to Mexico. That would entail quitting my day job, cramming everything I own into storage, and ravaging my savings account. It's just too easy -- and I've done it too many times before. It's why I'm nearly thirty and still sleeping (alone) on a futon in a cramped apartment with multiple roommates while my friends have wandered off, bought houses, married, and procreated. Besides. What if I did learn Spanish -- and nothing changed? For years, this has been my pipe dream: <i>If I only spoke Spanish, I would be more Mexican.</i> But what if it isn't possible to become a member of an ethnic or cultural group -- to will yourself into it, to choose? What if you can only be born and raised into it?</p><p>That would rule me out. I made a conscious choice to be white like my dad one day in elementary school. Our reading class had too many students, our teacher announced, and needed to be split in two. One by one, she started sending the bulk of the Mexican kids to one side of the room and the white kids to the other. When she got to me, she peered over the rims of her glasses. "What are you, Stephanie? Hispanic or white?"</p><p>I had no answer to this. Both? Neither? Either? My mother's roots dwelled beneath the pueblos of northern Mexico; my father's were buried in the Kansas prairie. I inherited her olive skin and caterpillar eyebrows, and his indigo eyes.</p><p>But in South Texas, you are either one or the other. Searching the classroom for an answer, I noticed my best friend, Melida, standing over by the brown kids. "I'm Hispanic," I announced. The teacher nodded, and I joined the Mexicans. A few minutes later a new teacher arrived and led us to another room, where she passed around a primer and asked us to read aloud. That's when I realized the difference between the other students and me. Most of them spoke Spanish at home, so they stumbled over the strange English words, pronouncing <i>yes</i> like <i>jess</i> and <i>chair</i> like <i>share</i>. When my turn came to read, I sat up straight and said each word loud and clear. The teacher watched me curiously. After class ended, I told her that I wanted to be "where the smart kids were." She agreed and I joined the white class the following day.</p><p>For the next eight years, whenever anyone asked what color I was, I said white. It was clearly the way to be: everyone on TV was white, the characters in my <i>Highlights</i> magazine were white, the singers on Casey Kasem's American Top 40 were white (or black). White people even populated my books: there were runaways who slept in imperial chambers at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Sweet Valley High twins who roared around California in convertibles, and girls named Deenie who rubbed their Special Places with a washcloth until they got a Special Feeling. (I sat in the bathtub for hours trying to find this Special Place. Was it that spot behind my elbow? Or just beneath my toe?)</p><p>True, I often wondered when their primos would burst onto the scene in their lowriders. And how come nobody ever ate barbacoa or cracked pi�atas or shopped for empanadas at HEB? But I took no offense at these absences. White people's stories just seemed worthier of being told. And so I grew closer to Grandma, in Kansas, because she resembled the feisty Jewish grandmothers in my books more than Abuelita, who lived on a ranch thirty miles out of town. I used to beg Grandma for stories about life on the prairie as she baked me vats of macaroni and cheese. She regaled me with the adventures of my great-great-uncle Jake, a hobo who saw America with his legs dangling over the edge of a freight train. When I wound up across the kitchen counter from Abuelita hand-rolling tortillas, however, I'd sit in silence -- and not just because of the language barrier. I simply couldn't fathom she had anything interesting to say. I'd watch her flip the masa on the burner and wish she'd whip up something like Are-You-There-God-It's-Me-Margaret's grandma would instead. Like matzo ball soup. I'd never tried this dish before, but it sounded like minimeatballs floating in cheese sauce.</p><p>I switched back to being Mexican my senior year in high school. I was thumbing through the college scholarship bin in the Career Center when my guidance counselor called me into her office and asked a familiar question: "What are you, Stephanie? Hispanic or white?"</p><p>Before I could respond, she offered that my SAT scores weren't high enough for funding if I was considered white. If I was Hispanic, she predicted, doors would swing open. "Think about it," she said.</p><p>I did for about three seconds, then changed the little <i>W</i> on my transcript to a big fat <i>H</i>. Suddenly, I qualified for dozens of additional scholarships. I applied for them all, and acceptance letters poured in. Not only was my freshman year at the University of Texas at Austin fully funded, but I also received free tutoring, a faculty adviser, and a student mentor, plus invitations to myriad clubs and mixers. It was quite exciting -- until I started meeting the other Latino scholarship recipient...</p></p><h2>The Folcroft Ghosts</h2><p>When their mother is hospitalised, Tara and Kyle are sent to stay with their only remaining relatives, their grandparents.<br><br>It's their first time meeting May and Peter Folcroft.

Open any page and you are back on the streets of the Haight-Ashbury in a time when that tiny urban spot was the Olympus of the newborn world. -- <i>The New York Times Sunday Book Review</i>This full-color re-creation in book form of all 12 issues of the psychedelic newspaper published in Haight-Ashbury from 1966 to 1968 provides a unique historical record for students of the 1960s, representing the works of the Beat poets, the hippies, and the followers of the anti-war movement. Famous for publishing such writers as Allen Ginsberg, Gary Snyder, William Burroughs, Alan Watts, Timothy Leary, Buckminster Fuller, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the tabloid also was well-known for its artwork, graphic designs, and rainbow colors. Editor Cohen, who was one of the paper's founders, contributes a fascinating history of the publication and its creators and contributors. Despite a table of contents, the book's usefulness as a reference is weakened by the lack of an index, and its $175 price (due to the archival paper used to preserve the book's historical value) makes this facsimile edition an optional purchase for libraries.<br><i>- Melinda Stivers Leach, Precision Editorial Svces., Wondervu, Col.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>King of Fashion: The Autobiography of Paul Poiret (V&amp;A Fashion Perspectives)</h2><p>Paul Poiret (1879&#x2013;1944) led the fashion world in the first decades of the 20th century. His autobiography tells the story of the meteoric rise of a draper&#x2019;s son to the &#x201c;King of Fashion.&#x201d; From his humble Parisian childhood, to his debut as a couturier, to his experiences during World War I, Poiret reveals all in this captivating tale, first published in 1931. His artistic flair, coupled with his remarkable and highly original cutting skills, enabled him to translate the spirit of Art Deco into revolutionary garments, and his memoirs bring this astonishing period to life. An astute businessman, Poiret describes the expansion of his fashion empire to encompass interior decor and the first designer perfume and evocatively recounts his extravagant parties, where guests paraded in his latest creations.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Born in Paris, <b>Paul Poiret</b> established his own fashion house in 1903.

In 1307 King Edward I of England, 'The Hammer of the Scots' and nemesis of William Wallace, died and his son, Edward II, was not from the same mould. Idle and apathetic, he allowed the Scots the chance to recover from the grievous punishment inflicted upon them.

Ludo&#x2019;s life changes the day he meets Lila, a girl from the aristocratic Polish family that owns the estate next door. In a single glance, Ludo falls in love forever; Lila, on the other hand, disappears back into the woods. And so begins Ludo&#x2019;s adventure of longing, passion, and love for the elusive Lila, who begins to reciprocate his feelings just as Europe descends into World War II. After Germany invades Poland, Lila and her family go missing, and Ludo&#x2019;s devotion to saving her from the Nazis becomes a journey to save his love, his loved ones, his country, and ultimately himself.</p><p>Filled with unforgettable characters who fling all they have into the fight to keep their hopes&#x2015;and themselves&#x2015;alive,&nbsp;<em>The Kites</em>&nbsp;is Romain Gary&#x2019;s poetic call for resistance in whatever form it takes.

For Gary the novelist, it is not only love and fellow-feeling that unites us, but &#x201c;the expression of suffering.&#x201d; Perhaps it took the suffering that claimed Gary&#x2019;s life for him to write as expansive a work of devout humanism as <em>The Kites</em>.

Noted author and historian Paul Harvey illustrates how black Christian traditions provided theological, institutional, and personal strategies for cultural survival during bondage and into an era of partial freedom. At the same time, Harvey covers the ongoing tug-of-war between themes of "respectability" versus practices derived from an African heritage; the adoption of Christianity by the majority of African Americans; and the critique of the adoption of the "white man's religion" from the eighteenth century to the present. The book also covers internal cultural, gendered, and class divisions in churches that attracted congregants of widely disparate educational levels, incomes, and worship styles. <br></p><p>Paul Harvey is professor of history at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. He is the author of Redeeming the South: Religious Cultures and Racial Identities Among Southern Baptists, 1865&#x2013;1925 and Freedom's Coming: Religious Culture and the Shaping of the South from the Civil War through the Civil Rights Era.<br>Harvey provides an elegant and engaging introduction to the history of African American Christianity that charts the diversity of experience and expression among black Christians and illuminates the complex relationship between religion and race in American life. (Judith Weisenfeld, Princeton University)<br><br>If you teach, study, practice, or care about African American religion, then this is the book for you. Paul Harvey provides an indispensable overview of black Christianity from the age of slavery to the ascendance of Obama. With it, Harvey offers a bevy of fascinating primary documents that range from Nat Turner's righteous rage to Mahalia Jackson's soulful songs. Through the Storm, Through the Night does it all with such clarity that even the most complex concepts make sense. (Edward J. Blum, author of W. E. B. Du Bois, American Prophet, and Reforging the White Republic: Race, Religion, and American Nationalism)<br><br>Harvey, a professor of history, examines the various roles that Christianity has played in the lives of African Americans. He begins at the very beginning, with Africans stolen from their homes bringing their own religious traditions, including both Christianity and Islam, with them to the Americas. The debate (and the rationalizations) among slave owners and other whites about what conversion to Christianity should mean is discussed as well the role the church played during and after the Civil War. Harvey then continues to the modern day, with an emphasis on the church&#x2019;s place in the civil rights movement. A leitmotiv that threads through the book is the importance of music in African American life and spirituality. The book ends with the dialogue between Barack Obama and his former minister Jeremiah Wright, in which Harvey finds two distinct strands of the black religious experience, 'the righteous jeremiad and the gospel of hope.' The list of primary sources that Harvey appends to the text adds value to what is a solid overview.<br> (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>Harvey (history, Univ. of Colorado, Colorado Springs) traces the development of African American Christianity from the transatlantic slave trade to the 21st-century megachurch, underscoring how the church served as a crucial institution and forum for African Americans in the United States as the country denied them a voice and equality. Not only did the church help African Americans endure and survive during slavery, but it functioned as a catalyst of the Civil Rights Movement. Harvey highlights important byproducts of the African American religious experience as well, e.g., music such as spirituals, gospel, blues, and even rap. He does not shy away from the criticism that African American Christianity has faced, e.g., for its exuberant style and preachers who have been accused of fraudulence. He covers today&#x2019;s religious pluralism, in addition to the rise of black megachurches and the 'prosperity gospel.' VERDICT Harvey&#x2019;s book is a concise and scholarly yet entirely accessible work, appropriate both for interested general readers and students. With charts, a helpful glossary, 'bibliographic essays' on primary and secondary sources, and a time line from 1491 (when the Kingdom of Kongo converted to Christianity) to Barack Obama&#x2019;s 2008 election).<br> (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>This deceptively slim book covers an enormous amount of historical terrain as an overview of African-American faith in America, touching a staggering number of major developments without exhaustively detailing them. Harvey, a professor of history at the University of Colorado, begins by explaining how the slave trade permanently altered religion for African-Americans, then moves on quickly to how the black church later provided cultural survival strategies. The same colonies that argued that the Bible sanctioned slavery hosted Protestant evangelical revivals where African-American Christianity was born. The book expertly pulls together the individual stories of well-known historical figures whose lives were shaped in black churches, the significance of syncretism in African and Caribbean-based religions as reflections of some elements of Christian theology, and the spread of gospel music as a new and influential part of American popular culture. There are some repetitive passages on Voodoo and Yoruba traditions, but the book is almost entirely a good, rigorous starting point for those unfamiliar with the place of African-American Christianity in America&#x2019;s history.<br> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Books abound on the African American religious experience in the US, but Harvey's work is a welcome addition and succinct summary of its 400-year history. Typically in such short monographs, detail is sacrificed for brevity, but Harvey (history, Univ. of Colorado, Colorado Springs) packs great substance through insightful biographies and aptly summarized historical events. He argues against any uniform African American church or religious experience, as African Americans experienced varied contacts with Christianity and often mixed traditional African spiritualism and animistic beliefs. Unquestionably, religious beliefs infused the African American community with hope as they struggled through slavery, Jim Crow legislation, segregation, race-oriented violence, and the civil rights movement. Harvey concludes that though the church is still relevant and Christian denominations are still predominant in the African American community, 21st-century immigrants continue to challenge this narrative, as the Orisha traditions of West and Central Africans, Cuban Santer�a, Haitian Catholicism and Voodoo, Ethiopian Eastern Orthodoxy, and Islamic influences further heighten diversity. The author notes that clannish and local community traditions among these immigrants overshadow any presumed unity based on skin color. In summary, Harvey creates a broad panoramic of the African American religious experience and challenges future scholars to increase scholarly attention to this field. Summing Up: Highly recommended. All levels/libraries.<br> (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>The diversity, complexity and tenacity of the African-American religious experience come alive on Harvey&#x2019;s pages....Harvey&#x2019;s inclusion of 40 pages of primary sources makes this volume even more valuable for readers interested in an extended encounter with the women and men they meet in<br>Through the Storm.<br> (<i>The Christian Century</i>)<br><br>Focuses on how Africans in America flocked to Protestant Christianity in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, used their faiths to challenge slavery and then racial segregation, and in the twentieth century became more diverse with massive new immigration after 1965.

Standing 345 feet tall, the N1 was the largest rocket ever built by the Soviets and was roughly the same height and weight as the Saturn. Though initially ahead of the US in the space race, the Soviets lagged behind as the pace for being first on the moon accelerated. Massive technical and personnel difficulties, plus spectacular failures, repeatedly delayed the N1 program. After the successful American landings on the moon, it was finally canceled without the N1 ever achieving orbit. The complete history of this rarely known Soviet program is presented here, starting in 1959, along with detailed technical descriptions of the N1&#39;s design and development. A full discussion of its attempted launches, disasters, and ultimate cancellation in 1974 completes this definitive history.</p><p>Eugen Reichl works for a leading European space transportation company.

Kennedy, the martyred President of the United States, appeared to me on three separate occasions, in three different places, and engaged me in lengthy disquisitions about the condition of man, the dangers apparent in his present estate, and what must be done to avert them.</p><p>I made it clear during these conversations that I was very dubious about the value of anything that I might be able to do, but John F. Kennedy assured me that for a number of reasons, which he explained, I was the likeliest person to proceed with this assignment.</p><p>I have lost none of the doubts which assailed me during these conversations. If anything, they have increased. First of all, I can offer no evidence to a mechanist or materialist society that the conversations took place. They must start or fall according to the information which they contain. There are no signed documents; there is no blurred photograph of an evanescent mist which I could claim to be the spirit of John F. Kennedy returning to his present mode of being. I cannot even say that I actually SAW John F. Kennedy during these conversations.</p><p>The physical, or rather, non-physical, circumstances of these encounters were quite simple. On each occasion, I was engulfed by a strange radiance in which the physical world disappeared, and I was serenely aware that I was in the Presence of John F. Kennedy. There was absolute peace, and I was under the impression that nothing ever had or ever could disturb us in these surroundings. It was as though one had attained a state of ultimate beauty, and had left behind forever all the cares of earth.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Shadow Girls</h2><p><b>From the dean of Scandinavian&nbsp;noirand the internationally bestselling and&nbsp;universally acclaimed Kurt Wallander series, comes this moving and profound literary novel about three refugee women and the poet they befriend.<br></b><br>Jesper Humlin is a mildly famous author and poet with lackluster book sales.

But as soon as she opened her eyes she was thrown out into an empty and unfathomable world, one in which nothing of her past remained except disjointed images of her escape. She lay still and slowly let herself float up into consciousness, trying not to leave her dreams without preparing herself. These first few minutes of the morning often determined the way her day would turn out. during the three months in the refugee camp she had developed a morning ritual that helped her avoid being overcome with sudden panic. The most important thing was not to rush up from her uncomfortable cot with the misguided notion that something momentous was about to occur. By now she knew that nothing ever happened here. This was the first lesson she learned after she had dragged herself onto the rocky european beach and been greeted by guard dogs and armed Spanish border guards.<br><br>Being a refugee meant being lonely. This was something that was true for them all, regardless of what country they had come from or what circumstances had forced them to flee. She didn&#x2019;t expect her loneliness to leave her soon, in fact she had prepared herself to live with it for a long time.<br><br>As she lay with her eyes closed she searched for a foothold in the confusion of all that had happened since her arrival. She was being held in a refugee camp in southern Spain, lucky to be one of the few survivors from that mouldering ship from africa. She could still remember the air of expectation aboard. Freedom has a scent, she thought, which only grew more overpowering as land approached. Freedom, security, these were what they wanted. a life where fear, hunger, and hopelessness were not the only reality.<br><br>It had been a cargo-hold of hope, she thought; although it was perhaps more correct to call it a cargo-hold of illusions. everyone who had been waiting on the Moroccan beach that night and who had placed their lives in the hands of the ruthless human smugglers had been ferried over to the waiting ship. Sailors who were little more than shadows had forced them down into the cargo area, as if they were modern-day slaves.<br><br>But there had been no iron chains around their ankles. what had ensnared them were their dreams, their desperation, all the fear that had driven them to break up from various hells-on- earth in order to make their way to freedom. They had been so close to their goal when the ship hit a reef and the Greek sailors had left in lifeboats, leaving the people in the cargo hold to save themselves.<br><br>Europe let us down before we even arrived, she thought. i will never forget that, whatever happens to me in the future. She didn&#x2019;t know how many people had drowned, nor would she ever find out. The cries for help still pulsated like a pain in her head. at first she had been surrounded by these cries, then one by one they had fallen silent. when she hit land she had praised her luck. She had survived; she had arrived. But for what? She had quickly tried to forget her dreams. Nothing had turned out as she had imagined.<br><br>A harsh spotlight had picked her out as she lay on the cold and wet Spanish beach. The dogs had run up to her and then the soldiers surrounded her with their shiny weapons. She had survived. But that was all. afterwards she had been placed in the refugee camp with its barracks and tents, leaky showers and dirty toilets. on the other side of the wire fence she could see the ocean that had released her, but nothing else, none of the future she had imagined.<br><br>The people in the refugee camp, so varied in their language, dress and terrible experiences &#x2013; imparted through a look or sometimes words &#x2013; had only this in common: nothing to look forward to. Some had been there for many years. No country was willing to admit them and all of their energies were devoted to avoiding being sent back. one day, as she had been waiting in line for her daily rations, she spoke with a young man from iran &#x2013; or was it iraq? it was often hard to know where people came from since they invariably lied about it in the hope that it would make their applications for asylum more attractive. he said that the camp was simply a large death chamber, a holding place where the clock ticked on relentlessly towards death. She had immediately understood what he meant but tried to ignore the thought.<br><br>His eyes had been full of sorrow. They surprised her. Since she had grown to be a woman all she had seen in men&#x2019;s eyes was a kind of hunger. But this thin man seemed not to have noticed her beauty nor her smile. This had frightened her. She could not stand the thought that men did not immediately desire her, nor that the long and desperate flight had been for nothing. She, like all the others who had been caught, lived in the hope that her ordeal would one day be over. Through some miracle someone would one day appear before her with a paper in his hand and a smile on his lips and say: welcome.<br><br>In order not to drive herself insane she had to be very patient. She understood that. and patience could only arise if she did not allow herself any expectations. Sometimes people in the camp committed suicide, or at least made serious attempts. They were the ones who were not strong enough to stifle their own expec- tations and the burden of thinking that their dreams would one day be realised finally overcame them.<br><br>Therefore, every morning when she woke up, she told herself that the best she could do was to rid herself of hope. That and never mentioning her true country of origin. The camp was always a hotbed of rumours about which countries offered the best chances for asylum applicants. it was as if the camp were a marketplace of countries where the possibilities for entry were recorded on a kind of stock market. No investments were ever long-lasting or secure.<br><br>A short while after she arrived, Bangladesh had been highest on the list. For some reason that they never understood, Germany was granting immediate asylum to all people who could prove that they came from Bangladesh. during an intense few days people of all complexions and appearances waited in line in front of the exhausted Spanish bureaucrats and argued with great fervour that they had suddenly realised they were from Bangladesh. in this way at least fourteen Chinese refugees from the hunan province made their way to Germany. a few days later Germany &#x2018;closed&#x2019; Bangladesh, as they said in the camp. after three days of uncertainty a rumour was started that France was prepared to take a certain quota of Kurds.<br><br>She had been unsuccessful in her attempts to research where the Kurds actually came from or what they looked like.

Fernando simply shook his head.<br><br>&#x2018;Tell me what colour you are,&#x2019; he said.<br><br>She immediately sensed danger, but she had to say something. The Spanish didn&#x2019;t like people who didn&#x2019;t answer their questions. a lie was better than silence.<br><br>&#x2018;You are black,&#x2019; Fernando said in reply to his own question. &#x2018;There are no black Kurds. Kurds look like me, not you.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;There are always exceptions. My father was not a Kurd, but my mother was.&#x2019;<br><br>Fernando&#x2019;s eyes seemed only to redden.

There is no Kurdistan. at least not in any official capacity. That is exactly the reason that Kurds are fleeing their country.&#x2019;<br><br>'How can they leave a country that doesn&#x2019;t exist?&#x2019; <br><br>But Fernando lost patience with her. he waved her away. <br><br>&#x2018;i should report the fact that you have been lying,&#x2019; he said. <br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m not lying.&#x2019;<br><br>She thought she could suddenly see a spark of interest in his eyes.<br><br>&#x2018;You are speaking the truth?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Kurds don&#x2019;t lie.&#x2019;<br><br>The spark in Fernando&#x2019;s eyes died away.<br><br>&#x2018;Go,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;it is the best thing you can do. what is your name?&#x2019;<br><br>She decided in that moment to give herself an entirely new name.

Jerry Dennis loves the Great Lakes, the swell of every wave, the curve of every rock. He wants you to love them too before our collective trashing of them wipes out all traces of their original character.

Along the way, inspired by the company of water in all its guises---ice, snow, frost, clouds, rain, shore-lapping waves---he meditates on the ancient questions about mind and matter, time and attention, wildness and wonder. As in the best American nature writing---a tradition that Dennis knows well---here the place and the explorer come together in brilliant conversation." <br>---Scott Russell Sanders, author of A Conservationist Manifesto <br><br>If you have been enchanted by Jerry Dennis&#x2019;s earlier work on sailing the Great Lakes, canoeing, angling, and the natural wonders of water and sky&#x2014;or you have not yet been lucky enough to enjoy his engaging prose&#x2014;you will want to immerse yourself in his powerful and insightful new book on winter in Great Lakes country.</p><p>Grounded by a knee injury, Dennis learns to live at a slower pace while staying in houses ranging from a log cabin on Lake Superior&#x2019;s Keweenaw Peninsula to a $20 million mansion on the northern shore of Lake Michigan. While walking on beaches and exploring nearby woods and villages, he muses on the nature of time, weather, waves, agates, books, words for snow and ice, our complex relationship with nature, and much more. </p><p>From the introduction: &#x201c;I wanted to present a true picture of a complex region, part of my continuing project to learn at least one place on earth reasonably well, and trusted that it would appear gradually and accumulatively&#x2014;and not as a conventional portrait, but as a mosaic that included the sounds and scents and textures of the place and some of the plants, animals, and its inhabitants.

Author and craftsman Dale Power revisits one of his most popular woodworking projects with additional embellishment, adding finery and fancy to what could easily become your final resting place. Easily, that is, since, more than 230 color photos and detailed instructions have been provided to help guide you step by step toward your own casket. This project might truly be your life&#39;s finest accomplishment. The installation of working coffin hardware, both exterior and interior, is explored and the proper application of finishes and linings are explained. Patterns for the coffin are provided, along with two lid designs. The color photo gallery and detailed instructions will challenge the novice and inspire experienced craftsmen.</p><p>Woodworking is usually a lighthearted hobby, so the idea of making a coffin could be somewhat odd or even repugnant. However, there is a place for such information in the library. It's surprising more folks don't build coffins, given the cost of commercial models and the fact that such a creation could be viewed as a tribute to a loved one or a catharsis for one who is ill. Power's coffins are attractive, with store-bought metal fittings and fabric linings, and could easily be mistaken for professionally made models. Experienced woodworkers would have no trouble replicating these designs. There isn't a large audience for this book, but it would round out a comprehensive public library collection. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Plague Tales</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Part historical novel, part futuristic adventure . . . chock full of curious lore and considerable suspense.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b><br><br>It is history's most feared disease.

For the men who fought, bled and died in them they are not small&#x2014;those little pieces of war&#x2014;and the personal aftermath and their effect is beyond measure. One such battle pitted a North Vietnamese Army (NVA) battalion of 700+ men against the men of Company I, Third Battalion, Ninth Marines, Third Marine Division. Of the seven officers in the field at the beginning, only three walked out. I was one of them.</p> <p>I was 24 years old, and this was my first significant combat experience (and surprisingly, what happened&#x2014;what I was called upon to do, was something I never imagined. What came afterward defined me for the rest of my life). The fighting lasted six hours, and toward the end, we were almost out of ammunition. Those few hours changed forever the lives of the survivors, including me, and the next of kin of the men we lost.</p> <p>That battle was the crucial event in my life; an ultimate <em>What Now, Lieutenant?</em> moment that taught me so much that came into play in other such moments in my future. True, they would not be as traumatic as what I experienced as a lieutenant, but they were moments that whether I was a lieutenant, major or general, each forced me to call upon my experience, knowledge, training and common sense to respond appropriately. That phrase... that question with all it entails and how one responds when it&#x2019;s asked of them... seemed to fit best as a title for what you&#x2019;re reading now. Seeing that question in the eyes of the men on Hill 70 that day is how I learned a most valuable lesson about leadership over the course of a bloody day in Vietnam, now more than 49 years ago.</p> <p>Everything that happened to me after that day is now seen through that prism. --Butch Neal</p></p><p></p><h2>Carmen Astrologicum</h2><p>Dorotheus of Sidon, who appears to have lived in Alexandria, flourished in the first century AD. He wrote his Pentateuch (five books) on astrology in Greek, in verse. This translation, from 1976 by David Pingree, is from a fourth century Pahlavi (Persian) source. The first book is on the judgement of nativities. Book two concerns marriage and children. Book three is on the length of life. Book four is on the transfer of years, i.e., forecasting. Book five is on interrogations, i.e., electional astrology. In this book are the earliest known astrological charts. Dorotheus bases much of his interpretative methods on the triplicity rulers, by day and by night. All fire signs have the same rulers. All earth signs have their rulers, as do air and water signs. He uses Egyptian terms. He, like the Greeks of his day, also uses the Dodecatemoria, which are the twelfths of a sign. And many, many lots, all defined. For the first time in this edition: Pingree&#39;s Preface newly translated. An appendix with charts in modern format. A complete table of terms and triplicity rulers. A table to calculate Dodecatemoria. Newly reset to match Pingree&#39;s original 1976 edition. Written a century before Ptolemy, here is the mainstream of Greek astrology. It will handsomely repay study.</p><p></p><h2>Anders Zorn, 101 Etchings (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)</h2><p>The "painters' painter," Anders Zorn (1860&#x2013;1920) studied at the Stockholm Royal Academy of Art and took up residence in London and Paris, where he established an international roster of high-society clients. His striking portraits rivaled those of his contemporary John Singer Sargent&nbsp;in their popularity. Zorn excelled at both watercolor and oil painting, and his etchings are of the highest quality. Uninhibited by the limitations of the medium, the Swedish artist exhibited complete mastery of the plate, bending the art form to suit his own direction. His etchings display the same characteristics and likeness of his paintings, consisting chiefly of portraits and genre scenes.<br>This collection of Zorn's finest etchings, which date from 1883 to 1918, features art from the 1922 Verlag Ernst Arnold edition. An ideal showcase of Zorn's artistic style and technical ability, this book provides a captivating gallery of people in repose and in motion&#x2014;making music, riding horses, boating, and swimming.

Almost never, in fact. And after tonight, I doubted I ever would again.</p><p>The shoot for the Men of Millbury calendar had been going on all week in the carriage house of a local estate. It was a fund-raiser for the Millbury Historical Society and we were desperately trying to save an old farmstead once inhabited by one of the founders of our nineteenth-century village. However we were up against a builder who was intent on knocking the house down and putting up a slew of cookie-cutter condos on the accompanying thirty acres unless we could stop him.</p><p>We&#x2019;d done the bake sale route. Now we needed some serious cash.</p><p>&#x201c;Having fun, Daisy?&#x201d; Mr. February, who also happened to be my very handsome husband, Joe Daly, came over and wrapped his arm around me.</p><p>I grinned and leaned into his embrace.</p><p>Not only did we want to save the character of our quaint neighborhood situated in bucolic Bucks County, Pennsylvania, but if we prevailed, the rambling farmhouse would be turned into a community center, providing badly needed recreation space for the local children.</p><p>Somehow my best friend, Martha, secretary of the society and a fiery redhead, had convinced these twelve brave souls to take it all off for the sake of historical preservation. Perhaps the fact that it would benefit the children had been the motivating factor, and not so much Martha&#x2019;s salesmanship or, should I say, relentless arm-twisting.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s crazy out there tonight,&#x201d; Joe said to me. &#x201c;Think you might need a couple of bouncers for the next guy.&#x201d;</p><p>There was high excitement in the air. Tonight we would see the cr�me de la cr�me.</p><p>Dark and dangerous Detective Serrano, in the flesh.</p><p>Literally.</p><p>Although these guys weren&#x2019;t completely baring it all. Depending on the way they made a living, the photographer had used a discreetly placed object to cover the family jewels, like a fire helmet, a barbershop chair, or a farming implement.</p><p>We were working in the garage of the carriage house, a beautiful space with heavy wooden timbers overhead and whitewashed walls. It was even heated, which was a definite plus on a wintry night. It would certainly have been easier to produce this calendar in the summer, when we could have used outdoor locations, but seeing as it was early November, the clock was ticking to get it printed and into stores in time for Christmas.</p><p>By the way, I&#x2019;m Daisy Buchanan, the fiftysomething-year-old proprietress of Millbury&#x2019;s antiques and sewing notions store called Sometimes a Great Notion. Actually I&#x2019;m fifty-eight, but fifty-something sounds better. I&#x2019;d kept my maiden name of Buchanan when we married. Joe was secure enough in his masculinity that he didn&#x2019;t have a problem with that, or with sitting bare-bottomed on his lovingly restored vintage bicycle.</p><p>All in all, this project had been a lot of fun. Our models had been pretty good-natured about the whole thing. Privately, I think they&#x2019;d quite enjoyed the fuss.</p><p>Tonight Joe had helped us by hauling in bales of hay and stacks of gourds into the garage, because first up under the lights was Mr. October, a former mailman whose hobby was growing giant pumpkins. He was in his early sixties now, but still in good shape thanks to years of extreme gardening. The plan called for him to hold a pumpkin in front of the essential bits, and there&#x2019;d been lots of cheerful ribbing going on.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, that&#x2019;s a mini pumpkin!&#x201d; he&#x2019;d yelled, still fully clothed, when Martha handed him his prop. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna need a bigger one than that!&#x201d; Martha had finally given Mr. October a large enough pumpkin to satisfy his manly ego, and she swept over to us, carrying a clipboard and trailing Cyril Mackey in her wake. I wasn&#x2019;t sure what the clipboard was for, seeing as we only had two models to keep track of, but I didn&#x2019;t dare ask.</p><p>She was wearing a gold wrap shirt, harem-style pants in a black-and-gold Japanese design, and high heels. The shirt gapped dangerously over her impressive curves, and I hoped the little snap fastener at her cleavage was up to the challenge, ready to give its all for God and country. Her bright red hair was twisted up into a thick knot, showing long shimmering earrings.</p><p>If need be, the photographer could always use her as another light reflector.</p><p>Eleanor Reid, president of the society and my other best friend in the world next to Martha, also sidled up to us, her gray eyes sparkling with anticipation. She wore her usual all-black attire&#x2014;a long-sleeved baseball shirt and yoga pants&#x2014;which actually seemed to fit tonight with her role as photographer&#x2019;s assistant. Her white hair was cropped mannishly short.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a huge crowd outside those garage doors,&#x201d; she said in her husky voice. &#x201c;All kinds of women from the village, not just from the Historical Society. Like a rock concert or something. Far out, man. I feel like I&#x2019;m back at Woodstock.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How did you ever talk these guys into this, anyway?&#x201d; Joe asked Martha. &#x201c;I mean, I know <i>I</i> was a pushover, but it can&#x2019;t have been that easy with everyone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, some were easier than others,&#x201d; she said with an arch look at Cyril, the cantankerous owner of the local salvage business.</p><p>He glared at her. &#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t know how I feel about taking my kit off in front of a bunch o&#x2019; gawping women.&#x201d;</p><p>Cyril was originally from Yorkshire, England, and until recently, a bit of an outcast whose wardrobe left a lot to be desired. The village was still intrigued as to how he and Martha, a wealthy widow, had embarked on their strange and precarious new romance.</p><p>I grinned at them. As a former cheerleader, prom queen, and trophy wife, Martha had spent a lifetime perfecting her stage presence. Even in her early sixties, she was still a knockout. Cyril, despite his tough demeanor, had swiftly gone down for the count.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, man, be a sport,&#x201d; Joe said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve all sacrificed our pride for a good cause.&#x201d;</p><p>Cyril took his tweed cap off and ran a hand through his thick gray hair before jamming the cap back on his head. &#x201c;I know, and that old bugger what owns the place has already scarpered to the bloody Outer Banks. So I hope a lot of people buy this damn calendar, and right quick.&#x201d;</p><p>He was correct that the current owner of the historic property had no real emotional attachment to Millbury anymore. The only thing he cared about was getting a nice fat check to fund his retirement. He&#x2019;d simply sell to the highest bidder.</p><p>I gave Martha a hug. &#x201c;You did such an amazing job putting this together. And Cyril, don&#x2019;t worry. We&#x2019;ll keep our eyes closed, I promise.&#x201d;</p><p>No women were allowed to stay for the actual shooting, well, except for the designated photographer&#x2019;s assistants&#x2014;Martha, Eleanor, and me.</p><p>&#x201c;There have to be <i>some</i> perks of sitting through the insufferably dull Historical Society meetings,&#x201d; Martha had declared when she&#x2019;d made the arrangements.</p><p>Far from my words providing comfort, Cyril&#x2019;s expression turned even more dour, if that was possible. But I knew there was no question he would come through. Cyril was nothing if not dependable.</p><p>At the rear of the garage, there was a wooden screen behind which the model could change. To protect his modesty as much as possible, we kept our backs turned until he was posed with his strategically placed item, and only came forward when requested to reposition something on the set or to hand Roos a new roll of film. The photographer was going old-school instead of using digital because he said he preferred the result.</p><p>Joe clapped him on the shoulder. &#x201c;Well, Cyril, after tonight, you&#x2019;ll be the last one, and then the ladies can get this calendar into production.&#x201d; He cleared his throat. &#x201c;So, Daisy, where&#x2019;s Serrano?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. July should be here any minute,&#x201d; I said, not even bothering to check my watch. Serrano always showed up on time for his rendezvous.</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me while I kiss the sky.&#x201d; Eleanor inhaled as if already catching a hint of his intoxicating aftershave in the air. &#x201c;Ah. The hot detective. Every woman&#x2019;s fantasy.&#x201d;</p><p>Martha shook her head. &#x201c;No. Trust me, dear. At our age, it&#x2019;s a fantasy to have someone <i>cook</i> for you every night. Like Joe does for Daisy.&#x201d;</p><p>My husband had blossomed into quite the gourmet cook, seeing as Millbury didn&#x2019;t have a restaurant, only a diner that closed at 3 p.m. He&#x2019;d convinced me to take early retirement two years ago from teaching high school, and we&#x2019;d moved into our former vacation home, a Greek Revival on Main Street. Joe had settled comfortably into country life, but it had been harder for me, and when I bid on a steamer trunk full of sewing notions at the local auction, it had been the inspiration to open my store. And my salvation.</p><p>So not only was I a resident, but as a store owner, I was doubly interested in what happened to our little village.</p><p>At that moment, the photographer, Alex Roos, strolled past our group, performing the habitual stretching moves that signified he was finished shooting in his crouching pose. &#x201c;People, people, how&#x2019;s it going?&#x201d; He flashed a wicked grin at Eleanor, showing capped teeth that were startlingly bright against his tanned skin. She blew him back a kiss. Martha just shook her head.</p><p>Roos wore black jeans, pointed emerald-green snakeskin boots, and a black leather vest that showed off his wiry surfer&#x2019;s body covered in myriad tattoos. His hair was cut in a Mohawk style, about an inch long, like the bristles on a silver-backed antique brush, and so blond it was almost white, the way some fair-skinned children get after a summer spent playing outside.</p><p>And like a soft brush, it seemed to invite the touch of your fingers.</p><p>&#x201c;Today&#x2019;s cock, tomorrow&#x2019;s feather duster,&#x201d; Cyril muttered. He would have probably spit on the ground if he was back in his junkyard and not in this garage that was nicer than a lot of people&#x2019;s living rooms.</p><p>The lanky photographer had caused quite a stir himself around these parts during the week he&#x2019;d been shooting. Even without knowing he was from California, it was clear to see he was an exotic bird among a flock of country fowl. It was rumored he&#x2019;d had almost as many liaisons as there were months in the calendar, including a dalliance with one of the married women. There was more than one jealous significant other who would be glad to see the back of him when he left town.</p><p>I narrowed my gaze at him. Was he really wearing eyeliner? In spite of his affectations, I had to acknowledge that he did have some strange sort of charm. But give me Joe&#x2019;s wholesome good looks or Serrano&#x2019;s dark and debonair sex appeal any day.</p><p>Roos clapped his hands together. &#x201c;Okay, peeps. Time to rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll. Next set, please.&#x201d; While I swept the garage, and the others removed the pumpkins, Joe loaded the bales of hay back into Cyril&#x2019;s truck.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to catch a ride back to Millbury with Cyril, so I can let the puppy out,&#x201d; he said as he kissed me good-bye and handed me the keys to our old Subaru station wagon. &#x201c;See you later, babe.&#x201d;</p><p>As I watched Joe and Cyril pull away in the truck, I blew out a breath against the guilty flutter in my chest for the imminent arrival of our next model.</p><p>Eleanor had borrowed a fake brick wall from the local theater, and the plan was to back the detective&#x2019;s Dodge Challenger on an angle into the garage and create the illusion of a grimy alleyway with a couple of garbage cans and some moody lighting. Serrano would stand partway behind the open driver&#x2019;s door, pointing his gun at an imaginary assailant.</p><p>&#x201c;Now, aren&#x2019;t you glad we talked you into joining the society?&#x201d; Eleanor said as we maneuvered the wall into place.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I answered dutifully, grunting as I pushed.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it was about time you joined, seeing as you were a history teacher, after all,&#x201d; Martha said, peering at us over her clipboard.</p><p><i>Okay, Tom Sawyer.</i></p><p>While Eleanor and I worked, and Martha supervised, I could feel the tension building, like the pressure in the air before a summer thunderstorm. The mailman was nice enough to look at, but he was nothing compared to the main attraction.</p><p>At the sound of a powerful muscle car rumbling up the driveway, we scrambled to open the garage doors. We stepped out of the way as Serrano executed a swift three-point turn and slid the gleaming black vehicle into position. He got out and, with a respectful nod in our direction, headed over to talk to Roos, exuding authority with every movement. I could see there would be none of the usual banter that we enjoyed when he stopped by my store in the mornings for coffee and baked goodies.</p><p>Tonight was a necessary evil he obviously wanted to get over and done with as efficiently as possible.</p><p>He was wearing a dark gray suit that complemented his closely cropped salt-and-pepper hair.

By which method should it be administered? At what age? What if one changes denominations? Laurence H.

The home kitchen and the restaurant kitchen are two entirely different worlds; the reasons we eat out and eat at home, whether serving our own family or guests, are worlds apart. Mark Peel and Nancy Silverton--who own and operate both Campanile, a restaurant that quickly rose to the top of the Los Angeles restaurant pile nine years ago and has remained there ever since, and the La Brea Bakery--are unique in their ability to span the two worlds, bringing a dollop of their restaurant's elegance to recipes that work in the home as well.<p> And it all comes down to their sense of what cooking is all about: "The purpose of this book is ... to illustrate that everyone, with a little concentration and passion, can prepare flavorful and deeply satisfying food... meals made from only the best ingredients, and the techniques of cooking we use to enhance and combine these ingredients." When those wonderful chanterelle mushrooms show up in their brief season, why be confused when you can step into the world of a Roasted Chanterelle Salad? Or Herbed Baby Chicken with Lemon-Thyme Butter? Or Penne with Gorgonzola, Walnuts, and Spinach? These are relatively simple dishes with the kinds of big, fresh flavors that will have your guests (and your family) opening their eyes wide with pleasure. You can't help but enjoy <i>The Food of Campanile</i> at home.</p>Established in 1989, Campanile immediately rose to the top of the Los Angeles restaurant scene, and it has stayed there by providing consistently sublime cuisine. Chef-owners Mark Peel and Nancy Silverton are well known for their personal mandate: If it&#39;s worth cooking, it&#39;s worth cooking well. The Food of Campanile skillfully blends sophistication and simplicity, making the recipes not only mouth-watering but entirely approachable for the home cook. From the subtlety of Roasted Chanterelle Salad to the complexity of Duck Confit and Cannellini-bean Ravioli with Port Wine Sauce; from the savory Black Cod with Brown Butter and Fresh Herbs to the succulent Braised Lamb Shanks; from the tartness of Chess Pie to the simple sweetness of Chocolate Chip Cookies (the likes of which you&#39;ve never tasted) - Mark and Nancy&#39;s dedication to combining the freshest ingredients with the purest inspiration can be seen on every page and tasted in every bite.</p><h2>Ballet for Life: Exercises and Inspiration from the World of Ballet Beautiful</h2><p><b>A chic and informative guide to the Ballet Beautiful method, featuring dance-inspired exercises, wellness tips, and lifestyle advice that help readers achieve ballerina confidence and self-esteem.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> After a career with the New York City Ballet, Mary Helen Bowers created Ballet Beautiful, a fitness and lifestyle program inspired by ballet&#x2019;s artistry and athleticism.

But among the talented men (and later women) who worked in mission control, the room located on the third floor of Building 30&#x2014;at what is now Johnson Space Center&#x2014;would become known by many as &#x201c;the Cathedral.&#x201d; These members of the space program were the brightest of their generations, making split-second decisions that determined the success or failure of a mission.

The subtlety and complexity of this project, and its implications for a globally engaged arts-based activism is truly impressive. <br> --Suzanne Lacy, artist and author of Leaving Art and Mapping the Terrain: New Genre Public Art<br><br>In a place where the United Nations used to be, somewhere in the Mexican southeast, Zapantera Negra kindles the Black Panther spirit from a caracol in a river that runs through history--a river that runs below ground for years, for entire centuries, and then rages to the surface or trickles up through the earth's rhizomes and roots. This art is urgent and inventive, an art of uniting peoples, an art of struggle born out of a moment in time, years, even centuries in the making.

Even more interesting is the story of the relationship at the heart of it all - the story of Hudson and Maria Taylor.</p><p>There are few love stories as enchanting as that of Hudson Taylor, the pioneering missionary, and Maria Dyer. Their relationship and short marriage flourished in the bitterest of circumstances because their lives were firmly rooted in their devotion to God, as well as to each other.</p><p>They were a perfect match, (though not perfect people), a couple who show us how to share our lives at the deepest level.</p><p>John Pollock draws his material extensively from original letters and papers. What unfolds is a picture of courage and adventure in Imperial China, a lost world of pigtails, Mandarins and dragon-roofed temples.

It was a dramatic and momentous time of political intrigue, bloodshed, and murder, one that boasted some of the most famous personalities ever to grace the Roman historical stage. Arguing that this pivotal year demands extended study, Stefan G. Chrissanthos's <i>The Year of Julius and Caesar</i> is the first focused investigation of the period.</p><p>Chrissanthos uses a single event as his centerpiece: the violent attack orchestrated by Caesar and the "First Triumvirate" on Bibulus and his followers in the Forum on April 4. Before that day, he reveals, 59 had been a typical year, one that provides valuable insight into Roman government and political gamesmanship. But the assault on Bibulus changed everything: the consul retired to his house for the rest of the year, allowing Caesar and his allies to pass legislation that eventually enabled Caesar to take complete control of the Roman state. </p><p>This detailed reconstruction draws on archeological and literary evidence to describe a watershed year in the history of the late Roman Republic, establish an accurate chronology, and answer many of the important historical questions surrounding the year 59. Written in an engaging and accessible style, <i>The Year of Julius and Caesar</i> will appeal to undergraduates and scholars alike and to anyone interested in contemporary politics, owing to the parallels between the Roman and American Republics.</p></p><p><p>How Caesar's attack on Bibulus marked the beginning of the end of the Roman free state and the descent of the Republic into violence and civil war.</p><p><b>Stefan G.

The sun has risen over the hills in the distance, and there&#x2019;s nothing but sand and scrub as far as the eye can see. I could be anywhere. There&#x2019;s no way to tell what century I&#x2019;m in&#x2014;-or what planet I&#x2019;m on. If I&#x2019;ve traveled back in time, I&#x2019;d never know the difference. And though I&#x2019;d rather not think about it, there&#x2019;s a chance I&#x2019;m being held captive in a capsule somewhere, with a disk attached to the back of my skull and my brain imprisoned in a computer--generated world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My eyes detect movement in a patch of dead brush. A scorpion emerges, and I watch it scuttle across the sand toward my shoe. The thing is a monster&#x2014;-at least six inches long&#x2014;-but I don&#x2019;t even flinch. My startle reflex has been dialed down to zero. I&#x2019;ve seen much worse in recent days. There&#x2019;s one thing that worries me, though. It&#x2019;s the color. I didn&#x2019;t know real--world scorpions came in iridescent green. If I had a phone, I&#x2019;d look it up. I&#x2019;m starting to wonder if I&#x2019;ll ever have a phone again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I send the creature flying with a kick and head back toward the car. Kat&#x2019;s there soaking up some early--morning sun. The sight of her pulls my thoughts back from the darkness. She&#x2019;s wearing a Budweiser T-shirt and a pair of hot--pink jogging pants with the word diva printed across the butt. She picked up the ensemble at a Walmart in West Virginia, and somehow she makes it look amazing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kat&#x2019;s reading a large sheet of paper that&#x2019;s spread out on the hood in front of her. &#x201c;Is that a <i>newspaper</i>?&#x201d; I ask as I approach. I can&#x2019;t even remember the last time I saw a print edition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nicked it from the hotel before we left,&#x201d; she tells me. &#x201c;Says here there&#x2019;s a pig--picking in Darwin next week. And Charlie Jones was arrested for stealing three chickens and a pregnant goat. I guess that&#x2019;s what passes for front--page news here in southwest Texas.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing about Milo? Or the Company?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She looks up from the paper and snorts. &#x201c;Are you kidding? Darwin, Texas, hasn&#x2019;t made it out of the twentieth century,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A gust of wind sends Kat&#x2019;s copper curls flying. I feel a twinge as she pulls her hair back and twists it into a bun. It suddenly occurs to me that the two of us may be alone. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Busara?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kat folds the newspaper and points to an identical stretch of desert on the other side of the road. There&#x2019;s a tall, dark figure strolling through the brush. From a distance, she looks just like her Other-world avatar. I&#x2019;m an idiot for never noticing the resemblance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While Busara&#x2019;s communing with nature, I grab Kat and draw her toward me. We&#x2019;ve only had a few minutes to ourselves since we sped out of Brockenhurst two days ago. We were officially a couple by the time we hit I-95.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Being on the run would be so much more fun if we didn&#x2019;t have a chaperone along for the ride. Instead I&#x2019;ve had to make do with furtive kisses. When I slide my hand around the back of Kat&#x2019;s neck, I feel the shaved patch at the base of her skull. Her hair is beginning to grow back in. She wraps her arms around me, and my head spins. I pull her closer and she loses her balance, sliding off the hood and landing on her injured leg.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Awwww, <i>man,</i>&#x201d; she groans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Shit, I&#x2019;m so sorry, Kat.&#x201d; I pick her up and gently put her back on the hood. She tries to smile but her face is ashen. She says her leg is getting better, but it still can&#x2019;t bear her full weight. She was injured in Otherworld right before we made our escape from the facility, and her real--world body suffered the effects. I&#x2019;ve been trying to convince her to see a doctor, but she won&#x2019;t run the risk. I suppose it&#x2019;s a moot point anyway. We don&#x2019;t have the money to pay one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d; I know the pain must be fading when Kat plants a kiss on my lips. Then she gazes over my shoulder at the wasteland I was just contemplating. &#x201c;What were you thinking about out there?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You were watching me urinate?&#x201d; I lift an eyebrow. &#x201c;I had no idea you were into that sort of thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kat rolls her eyes. &#x201c;I was just making sure you didn&#x2019;t step on a snake.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The green scorpion scuttles back through my thoughts. This time it&#x2019;s my turn to wince. Since I returned from my last trip to Otherworld, I&#x2019;ve been having trouble believing that everything I see here is real. This world and the other keep blending together. Maybe it&#x2019;s just my way of avoiding reality. It&#x2019;s still hard for me to accept the fact that, less than two days ago, I shot my girlfriend&#x2019;s stepfather. And it wasn&#x2019;t in a video game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you think Wayne is dead?&#x201d; I ask Kat. It&#x2019;s the first time either of us have uttered her stepfather&#x2019;s name since we left New Jersey. As I wait for Kat&#x2019;s answer, I realize I honestly don&#x2019;t know what I want it to be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Kat replies with conviction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;How can you be so sure?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Because we&#x2019;re not that lucky.&#x201d; I was hoping for more of a medical opinion, but Kat&#x2019;s definitely got a point there. Our luck hasn&#x2019;t exactly been stellar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We shouldn&#x2019;t be hanging out on the side of a road. It&#x2019;s time to get going again. The paranoia hits us both, and we look for Busara. She&#x2019;s headed back in our direction, as if the same alarm just went off in her head.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;How many miles until we get to New Mexico?&#x201d; Kat asks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Hard to tell,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Three or four hundred, maybe? This is the first time I&#x2019;ve ever used a fold--up, paper map. They don&#x2019;t make it easy to judge distances.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re absolutely sure we&#x2019;ll find Elvis when we get there?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I laugh&#x2014;-and remind myself that Kat never had the pleasure of meeting my former boarding school roommate. &#x201c;Oh, that part&#x2019;s going to be easy,&#x201d; I tell her. &#x201c;I doubt we&#x2019;ll be able to miss him.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Lesab�ndio: An Asteroid Novel</h2><p>First published in German in 1913 and widely considered to be Paul Scheerbart&#x2019;s masterpiece, <i>Lesab�ndio</i> is an intergalactic utopian novel that describes life on the planetoid Pallas, where rubbery suction-footed life forms with telescopic eyes smoke bubble-weed in mushroom meadows under violet skies and green stars. Amid the conveyor-belt highways and lighthouses weaving together the mountains and valleys, a visionary named Lesab�ndio hatches a plan to build a 44-mile-high tower and employ architecture to connect the two halves of their double star. A cosmic ecological fable, Scheerbart&#x2019;s novel was admired by such architects as Bruno Taut and Walter Gropius, and such thinkers as Walter Benjamin and Gershom Scholem (whose wedding present to Benjamin was a copy of <i>Lesab�ndio</i>). Benjamin had intended to devote the concluding section of his lost manuscript &#x201c;The True Politician&#x201d; with a discussion of the positive political possibilities embedded in Scheerbart&#x2019;s &#x201c;Asteroid Novel.&#x201d; As translator Christina Svendsen writes in her introduction, &#x201c;<i>Lesab�ndio</i> helps us imagine an ecological politics more daring than the conservative politics of preservation, even as it reminds us that we are part of a larger galactic set of interrelationships.&#x201d; This volume includes Alfred Kubin&#x2019;s illustrations from the original German edition.<br><b>Paul Scheerbart</b> (1863&#x2013;1915) was a novelist, playwright, poet, newspaper critic, draftsman, visionary, proponent of glass architecture and would-be inventor of perpetual motion, who wrote fantastical fables and interplanetary satires that were to influence Expressionist authors and the German Dada movement, and which helped found German science fiction.</p><p>Wakefield provides us with another top notch translation... An electrifying read. (Ian Baran <i>New York Public Library</i>)<br><br>Written in 1913, Lesab�ndio is equal parts philosophy and science fiction that mines an eternal debate: what is more valuable, construction in the name of science or creation in the name of art? For those pondering a professional future beyond their humanities educations, Scheerbart weighs the importance of technical discovery, aesthetic progress, and collaboration between artists and scientists. Bonus: Lesab�ndio is one of the most original alien characters out there. (Katherine Brooks <i>Huffington Post</i>)<br><br>A long-neglected German proto-Dadist, Scheerbart (1863-1915) has been rediscovered recently in Euro-American art and literary circles. This handsome edition of his Lesabendio is the latest sign of this recovery. The novel was first published in 1913, near the end of Scheerbart's life, is the most celebrated of his science fictions. Over 25 years, Scheerbart had published fantastic novels and stories with astral, orientalist, and political settings; newspaper sketches; poetry, including the very first sound poem; theatre pieces; and quirky tracts on architecture, politics, and science. He was one of the great early modernist stylists; if the prose of the novels is generally less radical than his major nonfictions previously translated into English-- Glass Architecture, The Perpetual Motion Machine, Aerial Militarism-- it nevertheless always sparkles. Svendsen's translation does this novel justice. Mostly, though, the luxurious flights of fancy are what captivate readers in this thought-provoking, gently satirical tale of life on the asteriod Pallas, starring a visionary (Lesabendio) whose technological and spiritual ambitions set in motion momentous changes for his fellow Pallasians. The original edition contained illustrations by the expressionist Alfred Kubin, which Scheerbart disliked; they are reproduced here, but in an appendix, a tactful editorial decision. (Christina Svedsen <i>Choice</i>)<br><br><i>Lesab�ndio</i> is an essential text and Scheerbart is a prophet in need of disinterment. (Erik Morse <i>LA Review of Books</i>)</p><h2>Exit Unicorns</h2><p>In this sweeping and powerful epic the journey begins in the &#39;terrible beauty&#39; of Northern Ireland during a time when conflict reigns and no one is spared from tragedy and sorrow, the time known as The Troubles. It is the spring of 1968 in Belfast and James Kirkpatrick has just lost his father under suspicious circumstances, Casey Riordan is released from prison after five years and Pamela O&#39;Flaherty has crossed an ocean and a lifetime of memories to find the man she fell in love with as a little girl. All three lives are on a collision course with each other against the backdrop of the burgeoning civil rights movement and a nation on the brink of revolution. They come from disparate backgrounds-Jamie a wealthy aristocrat whose life is like an imperfect but multi-faceted jewel-brilliant, flawed and with a glitter that is designed to distract the observer. Casey, a card-carrying member of the Irish Republican Army, who must face the fact that five years away has left him a stranger, a misfit in his own neighborhood where not everyone is sympathetic to a convicted rebel. Pamela, who has come to Ireland in search of a memory and a man who may not have existed in the first place. Through it all runs the ribbon of a love story: love of country, the beginnning love of two people unable to resist the pull of each other regardless of the cost to themselves and those around them, and the selfless love of one man who no longer believes himself capable of such emotion. It is an electrifying tale of a people divided by religion and politics, a tale of love and danger, of triumph and tragedy. Ultimately it is the story of that &#39;terrible beauty&#39; herself-Ireland-and how nation is bound to one&#39;s identity, woven into the weft of all we become.</p><p>I live in the interior of British Columbia with a menagerie that includes: one husband, three children, two dogs, one cat and an assortment of impermanent lodgers otherwise known as &#x2018;neighbourhood children.&#x2019; The two great passions of my life are writing and Irish history, in writing Exit Unicorns I have, I hope, fused these two elements together. Much of the fiction I read today has left me feeling that, while the writing was technically good, there wasn&#x2019;'t enough story to sink my teeth into. I believe myself to be a storyteller before all else. Thousands of years ago I would have sat by the tribal fire and woven tales for my shaggy-haired listeners. Very simply, it&#x2019;s what I was meant to do.<br> I&#x2019;ve traveled extensively in Ireland, particularly in the North where my story takes place. I walked the streets where history was made and smelled the smoke and blood of those times. I spoke with people on both sides of the political and religious divide about their beliefs and their struggles- this included a particularly memorable evening in an IRA pub. I drew from my own family history as well, the stories told by my great-grandmother who was a native of Belfast and left the country she loved because of political upheaval.<br> Currently I&#x2019;m hard at work on the continuing story of Jamie, Pamela and Casey that began with Exit Unicorns.</p><h2>The Body and Its Symbolism: A Kabbalistic Approach</h2><p><p>This intricate and profound exploration of Kabbalistic symbolism as applied to the human body is a classic in French esoteric circles.

McSorley said to Comiskey.<br> Comiskey gave him a quivering smile.&nbsp; "Aye, no worries."<br> Two cops got out of the car, donning hats and bright reflective jackets.&nbsp; The woman wasn't bad looking, light brown hair swept up under her cap.&nbsp; The man was tall and in good shape.&nbsp; His deep tan looked alien beneath the grey sky.&nbsp; They approached the Focus, the man leading.<br> The wipers scraped across the windscreen, the rubber-on-glass creak in counterpoint to McSorley's heartbeat.&nbsp; He put his finger on the button, ready to lower the window when the cop asked.&nbsp; Instead, the cop grabbed the handle and opened the door.&nbsp; Rain leaked in.&nbsp; It had been raining for nearly three months solid.&nbsp; All day, every day, no let-up.&nbsp; McSorley blinked as a heavy drop splashed on his cheek.<br> "Afternoon," the cop said.&nbsp; He had an English accent, hard and clipped.&nbsp; "Shut your engine off, please, sir."<br> McSorley turned the key.&nbsp; The engine died, freezing the wipers in mid sweep.<br> "Just keep your hands where I can see them, there's a good chap," the cop said.<br> That accent, McSorley thought.&nbsp; Officer class.&nbsp; It spoke of parade grounds and stiff salutes, not traffic patrols and police checkpoints.<br> The cop ducked his head down.&nbsp; "You too, gentlemen."<br> Comiskey put his hands on the dashboard; Hughes placed his on the back of the passenger seat.&nbsp; McSorley gripped the steering wheel and studied the cop's face.&nbsp; His skin was a deep brown, not the shallow tan of a week at the beach.&nbsp; His lips were slick from balm applied to the cracks, as if they'd been baked in some arid place.&nbsp; A vision of this cop crawling across a desert flashed in McSorley's mind.&nbsp; The image terrified him, and he couldn't think why.<br> The cop's hands stayed out of view until he reached in and took the key from the ignition.&nbsp; A black leather glove, expensive looking.<br> "What do you want?" McSorley asked.&nbsp; His voice bubbled in his throat.<br> The cop straightened and looked back down the road.&nbsp; "You're not wearing your seatbelt.&nbsp; Any reason?"<br> "I forgot," McSorley said.&nbsp; He looked to the rear-view mirror, knowing what he'd see.&nbsp; The van pulled out of the junction, turning towards them.<br> The woman cop walked to the passenger side.&nbsp; She leaned down and peered in, first at Comiskey, then at Hughes.&nbsp; Comiskey gave her a weak smile.&nbsp; She did not return it.<br> "Well, that won't do," the tanned cop said.&nbsp; "You don't want points on your licence, do you?"<br> The van filled the rear-view mirror.&nbsp; The woman cop waved, and it pulled alongside the Focus.&nbsp; The tanned cop reached in and hit the button to open the boot.&nbsp; It would have sprung up a good six inches when the car was new, but now it just loosened itself from the seal.&nbsp; The woman cop went to the back of the Focus, and the boot lid whined as she opened it fully.&nbsp; Cold, damp air kissed the back of McSorley's neck.&nbsp; The smell of manure from the fields around them mixed with the bitter sting of his own sweat.<br> The two men stayed in the van's cabin, but McSorley heard heavy feet moving inside, and then its rear doors opening.&nbsp; He went to crane his head around, but the tanned cop hunkered down beside him, smiling.<br> McSorley studied the peeler's face and all at once knew every tale the lines and cracks told.&nbsp; He had been in a dry and barren place, crawling in the dirt, hunting his prey.&nbsp; Iraq, maybe Afghanistan.&nbsp; Maybe somewhere the Yanks and the Brits would never admit to.&nbsp; And now he was here, not far from the Irish border, his sun-scorched face blank and unyielding.&nbsp; Just another job.<br> "You're not a peeler," McSorley said.<br> The cop's hard smile didn't even flicker.&nbsp; "Where are you headed today, sir?"<br> "I said, you're no peeler.&nbsp; What do you want?"<br> Footsteps scuffled somewhere behind the two vehicles.&nbsp; Something screeched and groaned as it was dragged along the floor of the van.&nbsp; Voices issued orders, hissed and strained.&nbsp; The cop's eyes never left McSorley's.<br> A voice said, "On three. One, two, three--hup!"<br> The Focus lurched and leaned back on its rear axle as something monstrously heavy was dumped in the boot.<br> "What the fuck was that?" Comiskey asked.<br> Hughes turned in the seat, but the parcel shelf blocked his vision.&nbsp; McSorley watched shifts in the light in his rear-view mirror.&nbsp; He wanted to weep, but smothered the urge.&nbsp; He heard more scuffling, then the thudding of feet clambering back into the van.&nbsp; The car's boot lid slammed home, and McSorley saw the woman cop through the back window, along with a heavyset man.&nbsp; The parcel shelf didn't quite find home, something pushing it up from beneath.<br> The woman cop carried a long sports bag.&nbsp; The heavyset man raised an automatic rifle.&nbsp; It looked like the Heckler &amp; Koch G3 McSorley had fired behind a Newry pub years before.&nbsp; The man approached from the driver's side, keeping the rifle on McSorley.<br> McSorley felt the heat of tears rising behind his eyes.&nbsp; Fuck if he'd cry.&nbsp; He swallowed them.&nbsp; The rear passenger side door opened.&nbsp; He looked back over his shoulder.<br> The woman cop reached in and dropped something metallic.&nbsp; Its weight thudded on the carpet between Hughes's feet.<br> "Oh, fuck," Hughes said.&nbsp; He scuttled sideways, behind McSorley, away from whatever lay there.<br> She tossed something else in.&nbsp; It clanked against the first object.<br> "Oh, Jesus," Hughes said, his voice rising into a breathy whine.<br> The woman drew a pair of long cylinders from the bag.&nbsp; McSorley stared at them for a moment, his brain struggling to catch up with what he saw, before he recognised the twin barrels of a shotgun.&nbsp; She placed it butt-first into the foot well, letting the long barrels fall across Hughes's thigh.<br> "Fuck me, they're guns," Hughes said as the door swung shut.&nbsp; "What's going on, Eugene?"<br> McSorley looked back to the tanned cop.&nbsp; The cop smiled, winked, and closed the driver's door.&nbsp; He held up the car key, showed it to McSorley, and thumbed it twice.&nbsp; The locks whirred and clunked.&nbsp; The cop placed the key on the bonnet, just beneath the glass.<br> "Christ," McSorley said.<br> "What are they doing, Eugene?" Comiskey asked.<br> "Oh, Sweet Jesus."&nbsp; McSorley crossed himself.&nbsp; His bladder screamed for release.&nbsp; He fought it.<br> The two cops, who McSorley knew were not cops at all, got back into the Skoda and pulled away.&nbsp; The van eased in front of the Focus.&nbsp; The man with the rifle grinned at McSorley.&nbsp; He kept the gun trained on him as he climbed into the open back.<br> Comiskey tried the handle.&nbsp; "Open the locks," he said.<br> "Can't," McSorley said.&nbsp; Tears warmed his cheeks.&nbsp; "The bastard double-locked it.&nbsp; You need the key to open it."<br> The van moved off, picking up speed.&nbsp; The man with the rifle waved.&nbsp; McSorley's bladder gave out.<br> "Oh, God," McSorley said.&nbsp; "Jesus, boys."<br> Comiskey slammed the window with his elbow.&nbsp; He tried it again.&nbsp; Hughes lifted the shotgun and rammed the butt against the rear window.<br> McSorley knew it was pointless.&nbsp; "Oh, Christ, boys."<br> Hughes hit the window once more, and it shattered.&nbsp; He lurched to the opening.&nbsp; Comiskey scrambled to climb back and follow.<br> Waves of rainwater smeared the windscreen as the van grew smaller in the distance.&nbsp; Hughes roared as he forced his shoulders through the gap.<br> "Jesus," McSorley whispered.&nbsp; "Jesus, boys, they killed us."<br> He barely registered the detonator's POP! before God's fist slammed him into nothing.</p><h2>Hawke&#39;s Prey (A Sonny Hawke Thriller)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Think: Elmore Leonard meets James Lee Burke.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jeffery Deaver</b><br><br>It&#x2019;s a stunning attack, lightning quick and chilling in its execution.

Discourses 1 and 2 (Loeb Classical Library)</h2><p><p>In the writings of Philostratus (ca. 170-ca. 250 CE), the renaissance of Greek literature in the second century CE reached its height. His <i>Life of Apollonius of Tyana</i>, <i>Lives of the Sophists</i>, and <i>Imagines</i> reconceive in different ways Greek religion, philosophy, and art in and for the world of the Roman Empire. In this volume, <i>Heroicus </i>and <i>Gymnasticus</i>, two works of equal creativity and sophistication, together with two brief <i>Discourses</i><i> (Dialexeis),</i> complete the Loeb edition of his writings.</p><p><i>Heroicus</i> is a conversation in a vineyard amid ruins of the Protesilaus shrine (opposite Troy on the Hellespont), between a wise and devout vinedresser and an initially skeptical Phoenician sailor, about the beauty, continuing powers, and worship of the Homeric heroes.

Not after midnight, not through Rocky Point Park. Not the way she was dressed in a tank top, denim cutoffs, and high-heeled sandals. Not with her twelve-year-old daughter Bethie. Not with packs of local guys running loose on hormones, rage, and alcohol. A victim of gang rape, left for dead in the park boathouse, the once vivacious Teena can now only regret that she has survived. At a relentlessly compelling pace punctuated by lonely cries in the night and the whisper of terror in the afternoon, Joyce Carol Oates unfolds the story of Teena and Bethie, their assailants, and their unexpected, silent champion, a man who knows the meaning of justice. And love.</p><p>Joyce Carol Oates is the author of more than 70 books, including novels, short story collections, plays, poetry volumes, and criticisms. She has been awarded both the National Book Award and the PEN/Malamud Award and has been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. She lives in Princeton, New Jersey.Prolific Oates (We Were the Mulvaneys; Beast; etc.) explores sexual violence and its aftermath in this taut, harrowing novella. Teena Maguire, a pretty, 30-something widow, is on her way home from a party when she is beaten, gang-raped and left for dead. She survives the attack, which her 12-year-old daughter Bethie witnesses, but as only a husk of her former self ("That pathetic woman," she thinks of herself, "they should have finished the job"). It is to Bethie, then, that the task of caring for her falls: "If Momma could sleep, that was good. It was your duty to let her sleep." Oates draws on shifting, often fragmentary points of view to tell the story of the days before and after the rape, including that of Teena's lover, Ray Casey, whose feelings have changed since the attack; Walt Pick, the father of two of the rapists; Harriet Diebenkorn, the deputy prosecutor who fails Teena in the preliminary hearing; and Bethie, whose affecting chapters are written in the second person. Redemption of a sort is offered in the form of John Dromoor, a young police officer whose concern for Teena is matched by his desire for justice. When a slick Buffalo defense lawyer devastates Teena on the witness stand, Dromoor takes matters into his own hands. This is where the story truly chills, as the attackers fret about their future and Dromoor slowly exacts a cool vengeance. The love story is Bethie's-a haunting affection born of a terrible crime. The effects linger, despite the book's brevity. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His book opens up new interpretive questions for historical theology with striking implications for ecumenism, ethics, and spirituality. <p>He writes, "the idea of the divine life in Christ which is present in faith lies at the very center of the theology of the Reformer." He argues that later Lutheran interpretation of this teaching has portrayed justification as more mechanical and forensic than Luther did, underestimated the extent to which Gods righteousness is also ours, and obscured the radical personal transformation that Luther attributed to justification.</p></p><p>Tuomo Mannermaa is Emeritus Professor of Church History at the University of Helsinki. <p>Kirsi Stjerna is Associate Professor of Reformation Church History and Director of the Institute for Luther Studies at Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg.

A miraculous sign, perhaps, but one the down-to-earth Amalia does not trust. Through Amalia, we take a vivid and moving tour of the &#34;other Hollywood,&#34; populated by working-class Mexican Americans, as John Rechy blends tough realism with religious and cultural fables to take us into the life of a Chicano family in L.A. Epic in scope and vision, The Miraculous Day of Amalia Gomez is classic Rechy.</p><p>Sexually abused by her drunken father, twice-divorced Amalia Gomez lives with her two rebellious teenage chidren, Juan and Gloria, in the decaying, gang-ridden outskirts of Hollywood. Rechy ( Marilyn's Daughter ), himself Mexican American, probes the dark underside of the American dream in this powerful portrait of one day in the life of a Mexican American woman and her shattered family. Amalia's battered girlhood in El Paso, Tex., and her relationships with husbands who abandoned or raped her come alive via extended flashbacks. Transplanted to California, she pretends that she's married to her live-in lover Raynaldo. Pious, she sees holy signs everywhere, torn by grief over Manny, her firstborn son who died in prison, possibly murdered by guards. Shattering revelations at the book's close concern homosexuality and sexual abuse under her roof. Rechy scorchingly evokes the prejudice faced by Mexican Americans and other minorities, the poverty, gang warfare, illegal border crossings and visions of salvation amid hopelessness. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Amalia Gomez awakens one day and looks out her window in the barrios of Los Angeles to see a silver cross in the sky--a sign from God. This Mexican-American woman is always looking for the brighter side of life, never wanting to face her real-life problems or those of her children, friends, or neighbors. From the early morning cross in the sky to Amalia's near murder at the end of the day, readers are given a glimpse of life in a decaying urban environment and see from Amalia's perspective the motivations and challenges of barrio life. Rechy, a Mexican-American author, presents a rich portrayal of Amalia in this readable and moving work, punctuating his work with Spanish dialog. The characters are vibrant and ring true.

For nearly a thousand years Christians have been hearing and repeating a story about why Jesus died on the cross. It&#x2019;s the only story of salvation most of them have ever heard. And it&#x2019;s wrong. The Bible doesn&#x2019;t have that story and the early Christians never heard that story - they never believed it. In Salvation (and how we got it wrong), Kenneth Myers revisits the story of our salvation, retelling it like the early Christians told it. No longer a tale of an angry God punishing his Son in payment for crimes against his honor, it becomes a tale of a loving God doing all in his power to bring healing to a humanity he desperately cares for.</p><p></p><h2>Explorers in Early Texas</h2><p>Discusses the Spanish and French explorations of what is now Texas, between 1519 and 1778, by Alonso Pi�neda, Cabeza de Vaca, Coronado, La Salle, Ter�an, and M�ezi�eres.</p><p>When the first Spanish explorer came to the land now known as Texas, they began a series of explorations that lasted over 250 years, from 1519 to 1778.

Originally published in 1851, at the zenith of British imperial power, it found an eager audience of readers who wanted to understand how Britain had achieved its tremendous influence and how long it would last. Since then, these chronicles of ancient and modern military confrontations have informed and inspired generations of students and armchair historians.<br>Educated at Eton College and the University of Cambridge, Sir Edward Shepherd Creasy was called to the Bar in 1837, appointed to the faculty of the University of London in 1840, and served as Chief Justice of Ceylon from 1860 to 1870. Creasy's scholarship and literary skill are complemented by his judicial attitude, which endows this book with a fair-minded, nonpartisan approach. He prefaces each battle with an introduction that explains the circumstances surrounding the war, as well as an afterword that considers how history might have changed had victory gone to the other side. Linking passages offer valuable insights into historical events that occurred between the major encounters. Influential and ever-popular, this book offers authoritative and entertaining analyses of the conflicts that shaped world history.</p><p>Sir Edward Shepherd Creasy (1812 1878) was educated at Eton and Cambridge, and worked as a lawyer and judge until 1840, when he became a professor of history at the University of London.

After his return to England in 1870, he wrote and published several books, though none received the acclaim of &#34;Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World.&#34;</p><h2>Conversations With Seth, Book 2: 25th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>In 1963, Jane Roberts met a spiritual entity named Seth. He spoke through her and the lessons he taught proved timeless and crucial. Roberts went on to write much about her channeling experiences with Seth and her books have sold 2.5 million copies. Her Seth material is consistently one of the top two most visited collections at the Yale University Archives.<br>From 1968 to 1975 Roberts held an ESP class in her home, during which she channeled Seth. Sue Watkins was a member of that class. The knowledge she gained from the Seth sessions changed Watkins's life. In fact, it changed the lives of all the class participants.<br>In Volume II of the Seth series, Watkins shares the insights she discovered while participating in Roberts's groundbreaking classes. The personal, social, and political issues addressed in <i>Conversations with Seth</i> are as relevant today as ever and include health, sexual identity, wealth and poverty, the military draft, relationships, dreams, ESP, reincarnation and more.<br>Seth expands on many of the topics raised in book 1 and also explores provocative new material: the correlation between our beliefs, dreams, and daily experience; the concept of probabilities, counterparts, and individual identity; the very real difficulties of applying the "you create your own reality" concept to daily life. Also included is a fascinating discussion of Christ. And, as in the first book, Seth addresses the personal, ongoing issues that class members experienced over the years--troubled marriages, illness, financial hardships, and more.</p><p>Susan Watkins is the author of books in several genres.

They were descendants of Japan's first Christians, the survivors of brutal religious persecution under the Tokugawa government. The Kakure Kirishitan, or "hidden Christians," had practiced their religion in secret for several hundred years. Sometime after their visit the priest received a copy of the Kakure bible, the Tenchi Hajimari no Koto, "Beginning of Heaven and Earth," an intriguing amalgam of Bible stories, Japanese fables, and Roman Catholic doctrine. Whelan offers a complete translation of this unique work accompanied by an illuminating commentary that provides the first theory of origin and evolution of the Tenchi. <br><br> Today, the few Kakure Kirishitan communities still in existence view the Tenchi as strange and flawed, expressing a distorted form of Christianity. It is, however, the only text produced by the Kakure Kirishitan that depicts their highly syncretistic tradition and provides a colorful window through which to examine the dynamics of religious acculturation.</p></p><p>From a universal religion the Tenchi constructs a system of beliefs entirely Japanese in spirit. Its earliest context was in all likelihood the encounter between a storyteller and a group of Kakure Kirishitan.Text: English (translation)</p><h2>See That My Grave Is Kept Clean: A Tommy Smith High Country Noir, Book Three (3)</h2><p><b>For readers of Craig Johnson and C.

Heal Your PTSD is not just a book to help you get past your trauma, it will also help you fully heal from it and get over it." --<b>Mark Goulston, MD</b>, author of <i>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder for Dummies</i> and <i>Just Listen</i>, <i>Reviews</i><br><br>"In her latest book about the nature and healing of trauma, Michele Rosenthal again provides an interesting and lay-friendly approach to the basic process of healing PTSD. She emphasizes self-help measures that the victim can use to supplement their healing process, thereby emphasizing self-empowerment, a critical but often neglected tool for healing. This is an ideal work-book for the trauma survivor to use in their journey to emotional health." --<b>Robert Scaer, MD</b>, author of <i>The Trauma Spectrum</i>, <i>Reviews</i><br><br>"Excellent.

The resulting fragments were never published by Pessoa himself and almost the entirety of them are presented in this edition for the very first time in history. This volume exhibits Pessoa&#x2019;s musings and wild insights on the history of philosophy, the failures of subjectivity, and the structure of the universe to reveal an unexpectedly scholarly, facetious, and vigorous theoretical mind. Written under the pre-heteronyms of Charles Robert Anon and Alexander Search, these texts constitute the foundation for the fabrication of Pessoa&#x2019;s future heteronyms. They are the testimony of a writer who referred to himself as a &#x201c;poet animated by philosophy.&#x201d; Through editor Nuno Ribeiro&#x2019;s careful critical efforts, a new and fundamental facet of the work of one of modernity&#x2019;s most seminal geniuses has now been brought to light in a remarkably reliable and clear fashion.</p><p></p><h2>Inventing Ireland: The Literature of the Modern Nation</h2><p>A critical history of modern Irish literature. Kiberd develops his story through subtle readings of such writers as Joyce, O&#39;Casey, Beckett and Bowen. Giving a controversial interpretation of post-colonial Ireland, he then surveys more recent works, from Brian Friel to the younger Dublin writers.</p><p>Declan Kiberd offers a vivid account of the personalities and texts - English and Irish alike - that reinvented Ireland after centuries of colonialism. Combining detailed and daring interpretations of literary masterpieces with assessments of the wider role of language, sport, clothing, politics, and philosophy in the Irish revival, this book is a major literary history of modern Ireland.Declan Kiberd was born in Dublin in 1951. He took a degree in English and Irish at Trinity College, Dublin, and he holds a doctorate from Oxford University. Among his books are Synge and the Irish Language, Men and Feminism in Modern Literature and Idir Dha Chultur. He writes regularly for Irish newspapers, has prepared literary scripts for the BBC, and is a former director of the Yeats International Summer School. He has lectured on Irish culture in more than twenty countries and has taught at University College, Dublin, for sixteen years. He is married with three children.</p><h2>The Moscow Trials As Evidence</h2><p>The Moscow Trials of August, 1936, January, 1937, and March, 1938, are generally regarded as frame-ups of innocent defendants. But there has never been any evidence that this is so. The present book submits the Moscow Trials to a careful study, in the light of the large amount of primary-source materials now available from the former Soviet archives and the Leon Trotsky archives at Harvard and the Hoover Institution. It concludes that the Moscow Trials were not frame-ups of innocent men. On the contrary: they were genuine trials, in that the defendants testified as they wished to testify. The Moscow Trials testimony, therefore, is valid evidence, and the conspiracies to which the defendants pleaded guilty really did exist.</p><p>Grover Furr has written many books and articles of research on the Stalin period in the Soviet Union.

Moody was a leading evangelist of his day, the founder of the Moody Bible Institute, and was well known on both sides of the Atlantic. R. A. Torrey was a close associate of Moody&#x2019;s and his successor as the director of the Institute. Torrey succinctly and compellingly presents the seven reasons why God used D. L. Moody: 1. He was a fully surrendered man; 2. He was a man of prayer; 3. He was a deep and practical student of the Bible; 4. He was a humble man; 5. His entire freedom from the love of money; 6. His consuming passion for the salvation of the lost; 7. He was definitely endued with power from on high. He then explains clearly what &#x201c;power from on high is&#x201d; and how Moody received and valued it.<br><br> A valuable guide to the Christian life.<br><br> FROM TORREY'S INTRODUCTION: <br><br> Eighty-six years ago (February 5, 1837), there was born of poor parents in a humble farmhouse in Northfield, Massachusetts, a little baby who was to become the greatest man, as I believe, of his generation or of his century&#x2014;Dwight L. Moody. After our great generals, great statesmen, great scientists and great men of letters have passed away and been forgotten, and their work and its helpful influence has come to an end, the work of D. L. Moody will go on and its saving influence continue and increase, bringing blessing not only to every state in the Union but to every nation on earth. Yes, it will continue throughout the ages of eternity.<br><br> My subject is "Why God Used D. L. Moody," and I can think of no subject upon which I would rather speak. For I shall not seek to glorify Mr. Moody, but the God who by His grace, His entirely unmerited favor, used him so mightily, and the Christ who saved him by His atoning death and resurrection life, and the Holy Spirit who lived in him and wrought through him and who alone made him the mighty power that he was to this world. Furthermore: I hope to make it clear that the God who used D. L. Moody in his day is just as ready to use you and me, in this day, if we, on our part, do what D. L. Moody did, which was what made it possible for God to so abundantly use him.<br><br> The whole secret of why D. L. Moody was such a mightily used man you will find in Psalm 62:11: "God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God."</p><p></p><h2>Captain (The Morgan Brothers)</h2><p>From, Lauren Rowe, the USA Today and International bestselling author of The Club Series and Ball Peen Hammer comes a sexy standalone romance: Captain.

Okay, sure, I&#x2019;ll put on a happy face this week and act like I&#x2019;ve never even met the jerk before--did I mention his sister is marrying my boss?--but that doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;ll like it.

Although she described herself as &#x201c;a simple creature unlettered,&#x201d; Julian is now widely recognized as one of the great speculative theologians of the Middle Ages, whose thinking about God as love has made a permanent contribution to the tradition of Christian belief. Despite her recent popularity, however, Julian is usually read only in translation and often in extracts rather than as a whole. </p><p>This book presents a much-needed new edition of Julian&#x2019;s writings in Middle English, one that makes possible the serious reading and study of her thought not just for students and scholars of Middle English but also for those with little or no previous experience with the language.</p><p>� Separate texts of both Julian&#x2019;s works, <em>A Vision Showed to a Devout Woman </em>and <em>A Revelation of Love</em>, with modern punctuation and paragraphing and partly regularized spelling.</p><p>� A second, analytic edition of <em>A Vision</em> printed underneath the text of <em>A Revelation </em>to show what was left out, changed, or added as Julian expanded the earlier work into the later one.</p><p>� Facing-page explanatory notes, with translations of difficult words and phrases, cross-references to other parts of the text, and citations of biblical and other sources.</p><p>� A thoroughly accessible introduction to Julian&#x2019;s life and writings.</p><p>� An appendix of medieval and early modern records relating to Julian and her writings.</p><p>� An analytic bibliography of editions, translations, scholarly studies, and other works. </p><p>The most distinctive feature of this volume is the editors&#x2019; approach to the manuscripts. Middle English editions habitually retain original spellings of their base manuscript intact and only emend that manuscript when its readings make no sense. At once more interventionist and more speculative, this edition synthesizes readings from all the surviving manuscripts, with careful justification of each choice involved in this process. For readers who are not concerned with textual matters, the result will be a more readable and satisfying text. For Middle English scholars, the edition is intended both as a hypothesis and as a challenge to the assumptions the field brings to the business of editing.</p></p><p><p>Nicholas Watson is Professor of English at Harvard University. He is co-editor of two Penn State Press books: <em>The Idea of the Vernacular: An Anthology of Middle English Literary Theory, 1280&#x2013;1520</em> (1999) and <em>The Vulgar Tongue: Medieval and Postmedieval Vernacularity</em> (2003).J</p><p>acqueline Jenkins is Associate Professor of English at the University of Calgary. She co-edited <em>St. Katherine of Alexandria: Texts and Contexts in Western Medieval Europe</em> (2003).</p>&#x201c;This is a fine and very welcome addition to the growing corpus of scholarly work on what may well be the most important work of Christian reflection in the English language.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury<br><br>&#x201c;This is an edition like no other. Word for word and thought for thought, Watson and Jenkins give Julian&#x2019;s texts the closest reading they have ever had. The editors&#x2019; daring break with current trends will make it much easier henceforth to read <i>A Revelation of Love</i> and much harder to evade the challenge of its intricate and radical thought. Adopting a wholly new approach to Julian&#x2019;s sources, the copious notes initiate the novice reader gently into the mysteries of Middle English, while inviting specialists to enter more fully than ever before into the process of making this book, which, in the final words of its author, &#x2018;is begotten by Goddess gifted and his grace, but it is not yet performed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Barbara Newman, Northwestern University<br><br>&#x201c;Embracing both scholarly and pedagogical needs, this remarkable volume meets the editors&#x2019; stated goal of providing an edition that is true to their understanding of Julian&#x2019;s rigorous and eloquent thought and that makes that thought accessible, as Julian herself would wish, to readers at all levels.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;E.

The petition had four demands: access to the same academic tutoring made available to their white teammates; better medical care for all team members; starting assignments based on merit rather than race; and a discernible effort to racially integrate the coaching staff, which had been all white since 1898. <br><br> The players&#x2019; charges of racial disparity were fiercely contested by many of the white players on the team, and the debate spilled into the newspapers and drew protests from around the country. Mistakenly called the "Syracuse 8" by media reports in the 1970s, the nine players who signed the petition did not receive a response allowing or even acknowledging their demands. They boycotted the spring 1970 practice, and Coach Ben Schwartzwalder, a deeply beloved figure on campus and a Hall of Fame football coach nearing retirement, banned seven of the players from the team. As tensions escalated, white players staged a day-long walkout in support of the coaching staff, and an enhanced police presence was required at home games. <br><br> Extensive interviews with each player offer a firsthand account of their decision to stand their ground while knowing it would jeopardize their professional football career. They discuss with candor the ways in which the boycott profoundly changed the course of their lives. In Leveling the Playing Field, Marc chronicles this contentious moment in Syracuse University&#x2019;s history and tells the story through the eyes of the players who demanded change for themselves and for those who would follow them.</p><p>This is the story of the Syracuse Eight, African American members of the 1969-1970 Syracuse University football team who risked their futures petitioning for racial equality.David Marc is the author of numerous books, including Bonfire of the Humanities: Television, Subliteracy, and Long-Term Memory Loss.</p><h2>The Next Pandemic: On the Front Lines Against Humankind&#x2019;s Gravest Dangers</h2><p><b>An inside account of the fight to contain the world's deadliest diseases and the panic and corruption that make them worse</b><br><br>Throughout history, humankind's biggest killers have been infectious diseases: the Black Death, the Spanish Flu, and AIDS alone account for over one hundred million deaths.

Mackin </b>(1898&#x2013;1974) joined the Marine Corps in early 1918 and was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment on the second day of the battle of Belleau Wood, June 7, 1928. Mackin was awarded the U.S. Army Distinguished Service Cross, the Navy Cross, and two army Silver Star citations for his valor from Octoer 3-5, 1918, at Blanc-Mont.Introduction<br> &nbsp;<br> This is the story of a young marine who fought in the Great War, told in his own words. It could just as easily be the story of any one of the two million men who joined the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) in France during the years 1917 to 1919. Fortunately for us, Elton E. Mackin was an intelligent man who clearly and concisely set down his thoughts on paper. Mackin also left an oral account of his experiences in tape-recorded interviews with his son in the 1970s. Those tape recordings greatly assisted the editor in developing the annotations that are found in the text of Mackin&#x2019;s book.<br> &nbsp;<br> Elton Mackin was born 22 February 1898 in Lewiston, New York, a small town just north of Niagara Falls. When he was six weeks old, his father, Arnot Mackin, drowned while helping a friend reach safety after a boating accident. Elton&#x2019;s mother later remarried and had four more children, three of whom were daughters.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mackin&#x2019;s formal education ended when he graduated from high school in 1917, a noteworthy achievement for a working-class youth in the early twentieth century. Innate intelligence, coupled with a more than adequate dose of common sense and service in the Marine Corps, completed Mackin&#x2019;s informal higher education.<br> &nbsp;<br> After high school, Mackin worked at various jobs until 23 December 1917, when he enlisted in the marines. He later said that a story in the Saturday Evening Post prompted him to do so. No personal record describing his early months as a marine survived, but we can guess that he was well trained for the ultimate role of any marine: &#x201c;to kill or be killed,&#x201d; as he so often liked to state.<br> &nbsp;<br> Long before Mackin took the oath of enlistment in his local recruiting office, the Marine Corps, not wanting to be left out of what promised to be the biggest conflict since the Civil War, managed to convince Secretary of War Newton D. Baker that it could supply a regiment of trained infantry as soon as war was declared. The marine commandant, Maj. Gen. George Barnett, soon received assurances that the army, desperate for manpower, would gladly accept a regiment of marines for service in France should the need arise. The army was true to its word: the chosen regiment, the 5th Marines, sailed as part of the first U.S. troop contingent sent over to bolster flagging Allied morale. Unfortunately, Gen. John J. Pershing, commanding the newly created AEF, and his staff were more concerned with building a first-class army, literally from nothing, than they were about a single regiment of marines.<br> &nbsp;<br> At first, the regiment was brigaded with several army regiments in the 1st Division, a regular army outfit. But, because the army&#x2019;s tables of organization and equipment called for four infantry regiments in a division, not five, the marines were assigned other tasks&#x2014;mostly construction and labor details. Pershing, facing mounting pressure to give the marines a combat job, decided in late 1917 to pull the regiment from the 1st Division and brigade it with several other army regiments then becoming available.<br> &nbsp;<br> By February 1918, the 6th Marine Regiment and 6th Machine Gun Battalion had arrived in France and, together with the 5th Marines, combined to form the 4th Brigade (U.S. Marines). Shortly thereafter, the 3d Brigade, made up of two regular army infantry regiments and the 5th Machine Gun Battalion; the 2d Field Artillery Brigade, consisting of the 12th, 15th, and 17th Field Artillery battalions; the 4th Machine Gun Battalion; and the 2d Engineer Regiment were joined by the 4th Brigade to form the 2d Division, which quickly became known as a first-class outfit. Later, many said it was the best division in France, challenged only by the 1st Division.<br> &nbsp;<br> The marines fit in well, becoming more and more like soldiers in appearance, if not in name. Because they were supplied from the same stores used to keep army units operating, the marines were forced to replace their trademark forest green uniforms with army khaki as the greens wore out. To avoid being confused with doughboys, the marines carefully transferred buttons and emblems featuring the Marine Corps&#x2019;s distinctive globe, eagle, and anchor to their new tunics, caps, and helmets.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the middle of March 1918, the 2d Division entered the lines in the Toul sector. The sight of their first casualties convinced the division&#x2019;s doughboys and marines that they were in a real war, indeed. In mid-May they moved to an area slightly south and west of Bar-le-Duc and Vitry-le-Fran�ois. During this period the 4th Brigade lost its commander, Brig. Gen. Charles Doyen, who was succeeded by army Brig. Gen. James G. Harbord. It was an interesting phenomenon: a marine officer replaced by a soldier. But the marines took it well and never gave Harbord anything less than their complete loyalty. The reaction to their new commander is best illustrated by the fact that, after the war, the brigade&#x2019;s officers commissioned a portrait of Harbord to be hung in the Army and Navy Club in Washington.<br> &nbsp;<br> Harbord held his marine counterparts in similar high regard. He knew he was getting command of a crack outfit. The story is told that Pershing called Harbord, then serving as AEF chief of staff, into his office and advised him that he was being given command of &#x201c;the best brigade in the army, and if it fails I&#x2019;ll know who is to blame.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> By the spring of 1918 the war was well into its fourth year. The Germans, realizing that the rapid American buildup would soon tip the scale irrevocably in favor of the Allies, launched a series of massive assaults at various portions of the Allied line. The Boche moved rapidly westward as the stunned British and French armies gave up ground.<br> &nbsp;<br> The French high command begged Pershing, who was patiently husbanding his forces until he could field a separate American army, to send them all available AEF units to help stem the German advance in the Aisne-Marne area, where the French army had fought the Boche to a standstill in 1914. This time, however, there were no fresh French troops on hand to work another miracle. Pershing approved the request, offering the French &#x201c;all that we have.&#x201d; To have done otherwise would have been tantamount to betraying the Allied cause.<br> &nbsp;<br> The 1st Division was already in the lines in the Montdidier sector and, when the German advance stalled there, the division gave the Boche a bloody nose with an assault on Cantigny on 28 May. Pershing offered the 2d and 3d divisions to the French command and promised to send additional units as fast as they were deemed combat ready.<br> &nbsp;<br> The 2d Division started along its path to glory on the morning of 31 May 1918, when its troops began boarding French trucks for the trip to Meaux, a village about twenty-five miles east of Paris on the Marne River and some fifteen miles west of the Germans&#x2019; front-line trace. It was a race against time as the Boche were rapidly rolling westward and the French command was so confused by the situation that it was sending reinforcements all over the map. Leading elements of the 4th Brigade were ordered to dismount at a town named Lizy, a little north and east of Meaux. But the marines were just one of the division&#x2019;s units, which were scattered all over the area. The story of how each unit found its parent and subordinate headquarters would make a chapter in itself. It is enough to say that the division was in a chaotic state and took several days to assemble. There was no divisional artillery and no supply trains, and none became available for more than a week.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fortunately, the Germans were also in disarray and had stopped to reorganize in and around the small town of Bouresches, a few miles north and west of Ch�teau-Thierry. The Boche especially wanted to take the town of Belleau.<br> &nbsp;<br> The 3d Division&#x2019;s 7th Machine Gun Battalion was the first unit to arrive in the sector, setting up on the south bank of the Marne across from Ch�teau-Thierry. Like a latter-day group of Horatios, the battalion&#x2019;s men bravely held the bridge there as elements of the 2d Division began to arrive and sort themselves out. The result was that the 4th Brigade occupied the northern part of the division&#x2019;s front and the 3d Brigade dug in along the southern half. This meant the brigades&#x2019; positions were the reverse of those specified in the division&#x2019;s operations order. The confused trip and assembly resulted in chance determining the ground the two brigades finally occupied. No one knew then that Belleau Wood, which lay across open ground in front of the marines&#x2019; positions and was only a small portion of the Ch�teau-Thierry sector, would soon become an important&#x2014;and ultimately very bloody&#x2014;segment of that part of the front.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was there that a rift began to develop between the doughboys and marines. For security reasons, the AEF refused to allow reporters to identify units by their numerical designations. The restriction did not apply to names, however, and American newspapermen&#x2014;most notably Floyd Gibbons of the Chicago Tribune&#x2014;identified the 4th Brigade as the &#x201c;Marine Brigade&#x201d; in their dispatches from the front. This meant that Americans, hungry for news about what their boys were doing in France, learned that &#x201c;the marines are fighting at Ch�teau-Thierry,&#x201d; or that &#x201c;the marines have taken Belleau Wood.&#x201d; Needless to say, their army comrades did not appreciate the publicity and loudly complained about &#x201c;those damned headline-grabbing sonofabitching gyrenes,&#x201d; adding a few unprintable expletives for good measure.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Star Trek 101: A Practical Guide to Who, What, Where, and Why</h2><p>In the future, a heroic captain and his crew explore the Galaxy in a really fast spacecraft.

The crew's standing orders from Starfleet are recited by the captain at the beginning of each episode:</p><blockquote>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the <i>Starship Enterprise</i>. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</blockquote><b></b><p><b>THE SHIP</b></p><p>The <i>U.S.S. Enterprise</i> NCC-1701 is an interstellar spacecraft with a crew complement of 430 men and women. The ship is powered by warp-drive engines that allow it to travel many times faster than the speed of light, covering great distances within a practical time frame. (You don't really need to know this to enjoy the show; just assume you'll be visiting an average of one planet per week.)</p><p>Because the ship is large and a bit ungainly, the <i>Enterprise</i> never lands. It wasn't designed for it. Whenever the ship arrives at a strange new world, it stays in orbit while a "landing party" either pilots a small craft down to the surface or uses the transporter to "beam" there (this will be explained later). The transporter, like warp drive, is a great time-saving device; Starfleet clearly employs a lot of efficiency experts.</p><p>THE MAIN CHARACTERS</p><p><b>JAMES T. KIRK (William Shatner), captain<br></b></p><blockquote><b>Risk is our business. That's what this starship is all about. That's why we're aboard her.<br> -- "RETURN TO TOMORROW"</b></blockquote><p>Kirk is the quintessential Starfleet officer, a man among men and a hero for the ages. His adventures are legendary. He has earned the admiration of his peers, the grudging respect of his opponents, and a chest full of commendations for valor. Cunning, courageous, and confident, Kirk is renowned for his ability to think outside the box, manipulating seemingly impossible situations like a master chess player. If he has one flaw, it is his tendency to ignore Starfleet regulations when he feels the end justifies the means. Kirk's unique style of "cowboy diplomacy" has served him well in countless close encounters.</p><p>Kirk was born on Earth in Iowa. He proved a very serious student at Starfleet Academy, remembered by a classmate as a "stack of books with legs." As a Starfleet officer, he is a study in contrasts. He depends on the state-ofthe-art twenty-third-century technology that surrounds him but prefers resolving difficult situations with a hands-on approach -- bareknuckle brawling or bamboozling sophisticated alien computers with his glib tongue. Kirk openly deplores humankind's ancient instinct for war and killing but has a deep-seated distrust of apparent peace and tranquillity. He dreams of "a beach to walk on" with a beautiful woman but firmly believes that man wasn't meant to live in paradise. Although Kirk has quite a reputation as a ladies' man, no woman has ever come between him and his career; his passion for the <i>Enterprise</i> always comes first. His most serious relationship was with Edith Keeler, a forward-thinking but ill-fated social worker whom Kirk met when he traveled into Earth's past.</p><p><b>Key Kirk Episodes<br>� "The Enemy Within"<br>� "Court Martial"<br>� "Shore Leave"<br>� "The City on the Edge of Forever"</b></p><blockquote><b>"You keep wondering if man was meant to be out here -- you keep wondering and you keep signing on." -- Kirk, "The Naked Time"</b></blockquote><p><b>SPOCK (Leonard Nimoy), first officer<br></b></p><blockquote><b>I have a human half...as well as an alien half, submerged, constantly at war with each other...I survive it because my intelligence wins out over both, makes them live together. -- "THE ENEMY WITHIN</b></blockquote><p>The first Vulcan to enlist in Starfleet, Spock (he has a first name, but it's unpronounceable) is the <i>Enterprise</i>'s science officer as well as its first officer, and the only man Kirk trusts to second-guess him on all major decisions. Why? Well, for one thing, Spock is probably the smartest man in Starfleet -- quite possibly the galaxy. His cerebral abilities are so renowned that they once inspired a group of aliens to invade the <i>Enterprise</i> to steal his brain. (He got it back.)</p><p>Like must Vulcans, Spock worships at the altar of logic. His decisions are always "flawlessly logical." Kirk feels safer about Spock's guesses than he does about most other people's facts. That's because Spock doesn't let emotions cloud his judgment. In fact, Spock has no emotions. Or so he says.</p><p>Spock is only half Vulcan. His father, Sarek, was a Vulcan diplomat; his mother, Amanda, a human schoolteacher from Earth. He was raised on his father's world, where the inhabitants are trained from birth to lock away their feelings and lose the key.</p><p>Growing up, Spock was torn between the stern discipline of his father's Vulcan teachings and the free-range emotions of his mother. The Vulcan children tormented Spock at school. His father didn't speak to him for eighteen years because Spock opted to join Starfleet rather than attend the Vulcan Science Academy. And Spock's fianc�e, T'Pring, spurned him at the altar in favor of a more traditional Vulcan.</p><p>Spock is married to his career, which is just as well since he claims to be immune to the charms of women. He has experienced romantic yearnings only under unusual circumstances triggered by alien spores and <i>Pon farr</i>.</p><p><b>Key Spock Episodes<br>� "The Naked Time"<br>� "This Side of Paradise"<br>� "Amok Time"<br>� "Journey to Babel"</b></p><p><b>LEONARD "BONES" McCOY (DeForest Kelley), chief medical officer<br></b></p><blockquote><b>He's dead, Jim. -- "THE ENEMY WITHIN"</b></blockquote><p>Given half a chance, Leonard McCoy is far more likely to explain what he <i>isn't</i> than what he is. He's not a bricklayer, psychiatrist, escalator, engineer, coal miner, or moon-shuttle conductor. He's "just an old country doctor" who happens to know a lot about twenty-third-century medicine. Born in Georgia, on Earth, McCoy still retains a touch of the charming Southern gentleman about him, which balances out his often cantankerous nature.</p><p>More than a little old-fashioned, McCoy isn't convinced that humankind should be gallivanting across the galaxy in a warp-powered starship. He loathes having his atoms "scattered back and forth across space" via the transporter, and he is disturbed by the fact that neither computers nor Vulcans have a clue about compassion. As might be expected, Spock's slavish devotion to technology, logic, and statistics drives McCoy crazy, and he's constantly trying to punch holes in Spock's cool Vulcan reserve. However, Spock is just as good at getting a rise out of McCoy, playing the good doctor's emotions like a concert pianist.</p><p>If Kirk represents the soul of the <i>Enterprise</i> and Spock the mind, then McCoy is undoubtedly the heart. The good doctor's insight provides the captain with a touchstone to his own humanity. He's the guy Kirk seeks out when he needs to let his hair down, generally over a drink.</p><p><b>Key McCoy Episodes<br>� "Shore Leave"<br>� "The City on the Edge of Forever"<br>� "Friday's Child"<br>� "For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky"</b></p><blockquote><b>"I signed aboard this ship to practice medicine, not to have my atoms scattered back and forth across space by this gadget." -- McCoy, "Space Seed"</b></blockquote><p><b>MONTGOMERY SCOTT (James Doohan), chief engineer<br></b></p><blockquote><b>I can't change the laws of physics.<br> -- "THE NAKED TIME"</b></blockquote><p>Montgomery Scott -- known to one and all as "Scotty" -- is the ship's miracle worker.

He refers to the ship's engines as his "bairns" (children) and is prone to calling junior personnel "laddie" or "lass." Scott's affection for the <i>Enterprise</i> may be a bit stronger than his devotion to the captain. He once started a brawl because someone likened the NCC-1701 to a "garbage scow." The fact that earlier Kirk was described as "a swaggering, overbearing, tin-plated dictator with delusions of godhood" hadn't bothered him.</p><p>Although he enjoys an occasional nip of Scotch, Scott generally prefers an evening with a technical manual to a night on the town.</p><p><b>Key Scott Episodes<br>� "Wolf in the Fold"<br>&amp;#!49; "The Trouble With Tribbles"<br>� "The Lights of Zetar"</b></p><blockquote><b>"Fool me once, shame on you -- fool me twice, shame on me." -- Scott, "Friday's Child"</b></blockquote><p><b>SULU (George Takei), helm officer<br></b></p><blockquote><b>Richelieu, beware!<br> -- "THE NAKED TIME"</b></blockquote><p>Sulu is a Renaissance man, counting among his passions botany, fencing, ancient handguns...and a subconscious desire to emulate Alexandre Dumas's swashbuckling literary hero D'Artagnan.

The success of his first novel, <i>The Collector, </i>published in 1963, allowed him to devote all his time to writing. His books include the internationally acclaimed and bestselling novels <i>The Magus, The French Lieutenant's Woman, </i>and<i> Daniel Martin. </i>Fowles spent the last decades of his life on the southern coast of England in the small harbor town of Lyme Regis.This collection of five short novels and one essay is characteristic of Fowles&#39;s intense, painterly vision of the natural world and the world of human relations. The stories are inviting: a painter living in seclusion with two young female attendants, a successful writer whose latest manuscript is destroyed, a medieval love story, a man who disappears and a family picnic in France on a sunny Sunday. Jonathan Oliver reads with meticulous care for phrase and punctuation, inviting attention to Fowles&#39;s image-laden descriptions, spare but enigmatic plots and mysterious revelations of character. Oliver makes the often jarring transition between novels gracefully. He captures Fowles&#39;s ironic tone but doesn&#39;t overplay it and is as much at home playing a young burglar as a lecherous film producer. L.R.S.

Even now, the basic requirements for human life--air, water, shelter, food, nature, and culture--are rapidly transforming the planet as billions of people compete for resources. These changes have become so noticeable on a global scale that scientists believe we are living in a new chapter in Earth's story: the Anthropocene, or Age of Humans. <i>Living in the Anthropocene: Earth in the Age of Humans</i> is a vital look at this era. The book contextualizes the Anthropocene by presenting paleontological, historical, and contemporary views of various human effects on Earth. It discusses environmental and biological systems that have been changed and affected; the causes of the Anthropocene, such as agricultural spread, pollution, and urbanization; how societies are responding and adapting to these changes; how these changes have been represented in art, film, television, and literature; and finally, offers a look toward the future of our environment and our own lives.</p><p>W. JOHN KRESS, a distinguished scientist and curator of botany at the National Museum of Natural History, formerly served at the Smithsonian as the Grand Challenges Consortia's director of science and the interim undersecretary for science. Trained in evolutionary biology, systematics, and ecology, he is also the author of <i>The Weeping Goldsmith: Discoveries in the Secret Land of Myanmar. </i>JEFFREY K. STINE is curator for environmental history at the National Museum of American History and the author of the award-winning books <i>Mixing the Waters: Environment, Politics, and the Building of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway</i> and <i>America's Forested Wetlands: From Wasteland to Valued Resource</i>.<b>WASHINGTON POST<br></b>Kress is the co-editor of &#x201c;Living in the Anthropocene,&#x201d; a new book by the Smithsonian that puts our current dynamic age in context through more than 30 essays by experts in disparate fields all affected by our changing planet.<br><br><b>SIERRA<br></b>Each essayist grapples with where we&#x2019;ve been (the Holocene and the end we have brought to that era), where we are now (rising sea levels, storms of increasing frequency, dramatic temperature fluctuations, and a timid global response), and where we are going...the book is itself a kind of road map for how to think about the new world we are entering, and how to cope with and chase away its many dragons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><br><br>KIRKUS REVIEWS</b><br>Original essays by leading scientists, historians, archaeologists, and anthropologists that address the related problems of unchecked population growth, scarcity of resources, climate change, and environmental pollution.Like many ecologically minded authors and thinkers before them, National Museum of Natural History curators Kress (The Weeping Goldsmith: Discoveries in the Secret Land of Myanmar, 2009, etc.) and Stine (America's Forested Wetlands from Wasteland to Valued Resources, 2008, etc.) warn that these complex, still-to-be-resolved issues will endanger humanity's future if they are not addressed immediately. As the title suggests, human activities have transformed terrestrial and maritime habitats, causing mass extinctions of other species at an unprecedented rate, comparable to a geologic turning point. "Our planet," they write, "has been experiencing a multitude of dramatic and far-reaching changes." The articles are grouped into five sections: "A Changing Planet," "Drivers of Change," "Responding to Change," "Visual Culture," and "The Way Forward." Smithsonian Institute geologist Scott L. Wing sets the tone in the first section. "We are no longer a bit player in the story of this planet," he writes, and "the influence of our actions now will change the global environment for at least hundreds of human generations to come." In the second section the editors suggest that we must widen our notion of biosphere pollution to include "space junk" like "expended rockets...and dead satellites." In "Black and Green," Lonnie G. Bunch III, the founding director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, points to the interconnections among environmental and racial issues created by the segregation in urban housing. In an upbeat afterword, renowned biologist and naturalist professor Edward O. Wilson emphasizes that if humanity passes through the current "bottleneck of overpopulation and environmental destruction...human existence could be a paradise compared to today." New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert provides the foreword, and other contributors include Stephen J. Pyne, Wade Davis, and Kelly Chance. A valuable contribution to the ecological bookshelf. <br><br><b>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY</b><br>Kress (<i>The Weeping Goldsmith</i>) and Stine (<i>America&#x2019;s Forested Wetlands</i>)&#x2014;curators at the National Museum of Natural History and National Museum of American History, respectively&#x2014;collect 31 essays representing a broad array of disciplinary approaches to the topic of the Anthropocene. Scientists, humanists, and artists offer their perspectives on the sort of future they envision while providing advice on the action needed to help shape that future. Though the voices are diverse, three major themes emerge. First, most of the authors are hopeful that there is still time for positive action. Second, despite that hope, most opine that time is short and meaningful action must be taken soon. Third, all agree that the future will look quite different from the present, from both social and ecological perspectives. For example, filmmaker John Grabowska explains the need to balance hope and despair in environmental films: &#x201c;Natural history films must illuminate the realities of living in the Anthropocene while reminding audiences that the natural world is precious and valuable.&#x201d; For their part, botanists Ari Novy, Peter H. Raven, and Holly H. Shimizu discuss possibilities associated with urban agriculture, which in addition to its ecological benefits may serve to build &#x201c;community cohesion.&#x201d; With so many perspectives present, there&#x2019;s something of interest to a wide array of readers.<br><br><b>BOOKLIST</b><br>The authors of this essay collection propose that the changes wrought by humans have created a new era, the Anthropocene, or the age of man. Arranged in sections from &#x201c;A Changing Planet&#x201d; to &#x201c;The Way Forward,&#x201d; the pieces range in quality and originality (those addressing climate change necessarily present known facts), with most of them very good and some excellent. Overall, the book takes the pragmatic view that we are in uncharted and precarious waters, and our job is to find a way forward. Also refreshing are looks at less studied issues, such as the effects of globalism on indigenous populations and how artists are portraying and influencing this new world. These essays are solid introductions for those seeking more awareness of the world around them; this audience will appreciate the further-reading list provided. For analysis of more personal changes caused by globalism, an ideal companion to this macro view is Dan Barber&#x2019;s <i>The Third Plate: Field Notes on the Future of Food </i>(2014).<br><br><b>LIBRARY JOURNAL</b><br> In this collection of interdisciplinary essays, edited by curator of botany Kress (National Museum of Natural History; <i>The Weeping Goldsmith: Discoveries in the Secret Land of Myanmar</i>) and curator for environmental history Stine (National Museum of Natural History; <i>Mixing the Waters: Environment, Politics, and the Building of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway</i>), experts address human-driven biogeochemical changes to the earth. The Anthropocene is the epoch defined by human alterations to the environment, as opposed to past environmental changes such as the ice ages. The exact start of this era is up for debate (and discussed in some of the essays), but it continues to the present day. The pieces are grouped into five areas: changes to the planet, causes of these transformations, human response, the role of visual culture as changes occur, and a look at the socioeconomic changes and environmental management needed to move forward. Color plates of the artwork discussed in the chapter on visual culture are included. The contributors come from a wide range of disciplines, such as archaeology, anthropology, economics, history, and art history, providing readers with different perspectives on the subject. VERDICT An excellent offering for those interested in environmental science and climate change.&#x2014;Margaret Henderson, Ramona, CA<br><br><b>CHOICE</b><br>Living in the Anthropocene is an edited collection of 32 essays representing a range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives on the Anthropocene, the name given to the current geological epoch in which human activities are considered a major agent of change on our planet. While the Anthropocene includes anthropogenic climate change, the term encompasses a much broader range of environmental shifts, including changes in agricultural practices, land use, and ocean biogeochemistry. Naturally, most research on the Anthropocene has been done by physical scientists. This text broadens how we think of the Anthropocene by complementing the traditional physical scientific approach with perspectives from leading scholars in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. The resulting collection provides a uniquely comprehensive and easy-to-follow perspective on the critical global transformation that is taking place. While there is some discussion of solutions toward the end of the collection, this is really a book about defining the Anthropocene and understanding the processes that collectively led us to this point. The wide-ranging perspectives of the contributors should broaden the view of any reader on what it means to live in the Anthropocene.--J.

In a state so famous for its pride, Taylor manages to write a very honest, witty, and wise book about Texas past and Texas present. <i>Texas, My Texas: Musings of the Rambling Boy</i> is a story of legacies, of men and women, times, and places that have made this state what it is today.&nbsp; From a history of Taylor&#x2019;s hometown, Fort Davis, to stories about the first man wounded in the Texas Revolution, (who was an African American), to accounts of outlaw Sam Bass and an explanation of Hill Country Christmases, Taylor has searched every corner of the state for untold histories.Taylor&#x2019;s background as a former curator at the Smithsonian National Museum becomes apparent in his attention to detail:&nbsp; Roosevelt&#x2019;s Rough Riders, artists, architects, criminals, the founder of Neiman Marcus, and the famous horned frog &#x201c;Old Rip&#x201d; all make appearances as quintessential Texans.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Lonn Taylor&#x2019;s unique narrative voice is personal.&nbsp; As he points out in the foreword, it is the stories of Texans themselves, of their grit and eccentricities, that have &#x201c;brought the past into the present . . . the two seem to me to be bound together by stories.&#x201d; People&#x2014;real Texans&#x2014;are the focus of the essays, making <i>Texas, My Texas</i> a rite of passage for anyone who claims Texan heritage. There are just a few things every good Texan &#x201c;knows,&#x201d; like the fact that it is illegal to pick bluebonnets along the highway, or that the Menger Hotel bar is modeled after the one in the House of Lords in London. Taylor points out with his usual wit that it is not, in fact, illegal to pick any of the six varieties of bluebonnets that grow throughout our state, and that few Texans would know that the bar is modeled after the one in the House of Lords, as few Texans are Lords. These are just a few examples of Taylor&#x2019;s knowledge of Texas and his passion for its citizens.</p><p><p>LONN TAYLOR is a Texas native who has had a distinguished career as an author, columnist, and museum curator.&nbsp; Taylor&#x2019;s books include <i>Texas Furniture: The Cabinetmakers and Their Work, 1840-1880</i> (with David Warren, University of Texas Press, 1975); <i>The American Cowboy</i> (with Ingrid Marr, Library of Congress, 1983); <i>New Mexican Furniture, 1600-1940</i> (with Dessa Bokides, Museum of New Mexico Press, 1987); <i>The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem</i> (Harry N.

American forces were forced to improvise under enemy fire, and although they were ultimately victorious, they suffered devastating casualties. <br><br>Why did the Allies embark on an attack with so many disadvantages? Making extensive use of primary sources, Adrian Lewis traces the development of the doctrine behind the plan for the invasion of Normandy to explain why the battles for the beaches were fought as they were.<br><br>Although blame for the Omaha Beach disaster has traditionally been placed on tactical leaders at the battle site, Lewis argues that the real responsibility lay at the higher levels of operations and strategy planning. Ignoring lessons learned in the Mediterranean and Pacific theaters, British and American military leaders employed a hybrid doctrine of amphibious warfare at Normandy, one that failed to maximize the advantages of either British or U.S. doctrine. Had Allied forces at the other landing sites faced German forces of the quality and quantity of those at Omaha Beach, Lewis says, they too would have suffered heavy casualties and faced the prospect of defeat.<br><br><br><br></p><p>"A major contribution to our understanding of the assault on Omaha Beach."-- <i>Journal of Military History</i> <br>Adrian R.

Between 1941 and 1944, some 1.4 million Jews were killed there, and one of the most important centers of Jewish life was destroyed. Yet, little is known about this chapter of Holocaust history. Drawing on archival sources from the former Soviet Union and bringing together researchers from Ukraine, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and the United States, The Shoah in Ukraine sheds light on the critical themes of perpetration, collaboration, Jewish-Ukrainian relations, testimony, rescue, and Holocaust remembrance in Ukraine.</p><p>Contributors are Andrej Angrick, Omer Bartov, Karel C.

Bush (Focus on American History Series)</h2><p><p>America&#x2019;s forty-third president, George W. Bush, presided over eight of the most dramatic years in recent history, from the 9/11 attacks early in his administration to the worldwide economic crisis of 2008. By his side, recording every event from the momentous to the intimate, was his personal White House photographer, Eric Draper. From a collection of nearly one million photographs, Draper has selected more than one hundred images of President Bush that portray both the public figure and the private man.</p><p>Front Row Seat presents a compelling, behind-the-scenes view of the presidency of George W. Bush. Through Draper&#x2019;s lens, we follow Bush through moments of crisis that called for strong leadership, such as 9/11; emotional meetings with troops in war zones, wounded soldiers at home, and Katrina survivors; and happy, relaxed times with his wife Laura, daughters Barbara and Jenna, and parents President George H. W. and Barbara Bush. We also see Bush at work within his inner circle of trusted advisors, including Vice President Richard Cheney, National Security Advisor and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.</p><p>Capturing moments that reveal the essence of the man, Front Row Seat is an irreplaceable portrait of George W. Bush.</p></p><p>The longest-serving Chief White House Photographer and the first to document two full terms, Eric Draper covered George W. Bush for the entire eight years of his presidency. He was also named Special Assistant to the President. During his tenure, Draper directed the photographic and archival conversion of the White House Photo Office from film to digital. Prior to joining the White House, he was West Regional Enterprise Photographer for the Associated Press and had also worked as a staff photographer for the Seattle Times, Pasadena Star-News, and Albuquerque Tribune. He is currently a freelance political, corporate, editorial, and wedding photographer."Nothing captures history like great photography. In his role as White House photographer, Eric Draper carried on the great tradition of vividly documenting history as it unfolded before us. Whether covering events like 9/11 or President Bush interacting with AIDs orphans in Africa, Eric&#x2019;s photos always recorded the moments that mattered."

When a mysterious illness strikes Caitlin down, Megan is forced to forage for medical supplies at a remote lodge. The last thing she wants is help from her fellow survivors when so many in her life have let her down&#x2014;but soon she'll find herself with no other option. Ex-Navy SEAL Wyatt Morris is doing everything he can to hold his family together after the tragic death of his prepper Dad, so when Megan enters their lands, he is mistrustful at first despite feeling drawn to her. He won't turn away an ill child though--no matter how deadly the world has become. But the arrival of another stranger named Kyle soon gives them all a new reason to be suspicious. Wyatt knows he&#x2019;ll have to forge alliances in order to keep his family safe, but trusting the wrong person could be a deadly mistake. When Megan and Wyatt discover her daughter&#x2019;s illness may be linked to Kyle&#x2019;s arrival, it sets off a race to discover the truth before it&#x2019;s too late to save Caitlin&#x2014;and the rest of the Morris clan.

After being stuck in a mountain cabin for six days following a flash flood, she decided she never wanted to feel so powerless or have to send her kids to bed hungry again. Now she lives the prepper lifestyle and knows that if SHTF or TEOTWAWKI happens, she&#x2019;ll be ready to help protect and provide for her family. Combine this survivalist mentality with a vivid imagination (as well as a slightly unhealthy day dreaming habit) and you get a prepper fiction author. Grace spends her days thinking about the worst possible survival situations that a person could be thrown into, then throwing her characters into these nightmares while trying to figure out "What SHOULD you do in this situation?" It&#x2019;s her wish that through her characters, you will get to experience what life will be like and essentially learn from their mistakes and experiences, so that you too can survive!</p><h2>Try Common Sense: Replacing the Failed Ideologies of Right and Left</h2><p><p><strong>Award-winning author Philip K. Howard lays out the blueprint for a new American society.</strong></p><p>In this brief and powerful book, Philip K. Howard attacks the failed ideologies of both parties and proposes a radical simplification of government to re-empower Americans in their daily choices. Nothing will make sense until people are free to roll up their sleeves and make things work. The first steps are to abandon the philosophy of correctness and our devotion to mindless compliance.</p><p>Americans are a practical people. They want government to be practical. Washington can&#x2019;t do anything practically. Worse, its bureaucracy prevents Americans from doing what&#x2019;s sensible. Conservative bluster won&#x2019;t fix this problem. Liberal hand-wringing won&#x2019;t work either. Frustrated voters reach for extremist leaders, but they too get bogged down in the bureaucracy that has accumulated over the past century. Howard shows how America can push the reset button and create simpler frameworks focused on public goals where officials&#x2015;prepare for the shock&#x2015;are actually accountable for getting the job done.</p></p><p><p><strong>Praise for Philip K. Howard's previous books:</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Rule of Nobody: Saving America from Dead Law and Broken Government</em></strong><br> "Amid the liberal-conservative ideological clash that paralyzes our government, it&#x2019;s refreshing to encounter the views of Philip K.

For hundreds of years, Earth has suffered under the yoke of alien conquerors: the dreaded Tyr, a reptilian race in which all individuality is submerged into a single, overarching consciousness. Determined to keep humanity cowed, the Tyr have culled from the captive population the most intelligent, the most curious, the most likely to foment rebellion, and banished them from Earth. As the memory of freedom recedes, humanity sinks into a lethargic subservience. Daetrin, the hero of this tale, is a vampire--not a monster, however, but a man, nearly immortal, who embodies the vanished virtues of a once-sovereign Earth. When his existence is exposed by the Tyr, who are appalled to find a human who witnessed the stet cap/pk Conquest, they immediately ship him offworld. Thus begins a journey of self-discovery as Daetrin is forced by adversity to come to grips with the long-suppressed side of his nature and to confront the ancient horror of a bloody heritage. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Who Counts?: The Mathematics of Death and Life after Genocide</h2><p>In <i>Who Counts?</i> Diane M. Nelson explores the social life of numbers, teasing out the myriad roles math plays in Guatemalan state violence, economic exploitation, and disenfranchisement, as well as in Mayan revitalization and grassroots environmental struggles. In the aftermath of thirty-six years of civil war, to count&#x2014;both numerically and in the sense of having value&#x2014;is a contested and qualitative practice of complex calculations encompassing war losses, migration, debt, and competing understandings of progress. Nelson makes broad connections among seemingly divergent phenomena, such as debates over reparations for genocide victims, Ponzi schemes, and antimining movements. Challenging the presumed objectivity of Western mathematics, Nelson shows how it flattens social complexity and becomes a raced, classed, and gendered skill that colonial powers considered beyond the grasp of indigenous peoples. Yet the Classic Maya are famous for the precision of their mathematics, including conceptualizing zero long before Europeans. Nelson shows how Guatemala's indigenous population is increasingly returning to Mayan numeracy to critique systemic inequalities with the goal of being counted&#x2014;in every sense of the word.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Diane M. Nelson is Professor of Cultural Anthropology at Duke University and the author of <i>A Finger in the Wound: Body Politics in Quincentennial Guatemala</i>; she is also the author of <i>Reckoning: The Ends of War in Guatemala</i> and coeditor of <i>War by Other Means: Aftermath in Post-Genocide Guatemala</i>, both also published by Duke University Press.&nbsp;"...I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in Guatemala, postgenocidal reconstruction, environmental justice movements, or the social embeddedness of economic rationality." -- Rebecca Nelson, <i>Anthropology Book Forum</i> Published On: 2016-06-01<br><br>"In the end, it is a meditation on both Guatemala and numbers that Nelson offers, and . . . &nbsp;for me her book succeeds on both counts." -- Douglas V.

Fischer, <i>Bulletin of Latin American Research</i> Published On: 2017-10-01<br><br>"Without sacrificing intellectual rigor, the book is written in a conversational tone, making it an enjoyable read.... Scholars who study truth commissions and reparations, as well as those who investigate lived experiences of imperialism and neoliberalism, will find the book especially useful. In general, the book is highly recommended for readers interested in how numbers and counting systems organize social life and shape our understanding of the world." -- Brandi Townsend, <i>The Latin Americanist</i> Published On: 2017-09-01<br><br>"A must-read for scholars of genocide, human rights, and Indigenous organizing throughout the Americas. . . . In this third book of what Nelson calls a genocide trilogy (263), she masterfully crafts an expansive analysis of Maya lifeways in precarious postwar Guatemala.

Original. UP.</p><p>In her first book, Black Feminist Thought (Routledge, 1990), Collins (sociology, Univ. of Cincinnati) looked at the role of African American women in the feminist movement. Here she focuses on the prejudices they face. Collins discusses the culture of silence in which African American women are seen but not heard, making them outsiders within their own race. She notes that their accomplishments are often ignored, especially when the women transcend expectations. She points to Mary McLeod Bethune, whose role in FDR's administration is often overlooked, and Angela Davis, who found that her Civil Rights work boiled down to her Afro hairdo. Collins discusses the need for African American women to avoid being segmented into areas the present culture finds acceptable. This is a difficult book but well worth the read.

The views of the invaded are represented by Kaqchikel and Tz&#x2019;utujil accounts.

I broke stride, put down my coffee, and glanced at my pager: I was needed in the emergency room. It was 2014, an unseasonably warm October day, and the text induced a flurry of anxiety and excitement. After eleven years of training, I had accepted a position as a staff physician at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, a tertiary care center on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, and a patient had just arrived with a perplexing infection, one that had stumped the team in the ER.<br><br> A moment later, I was standing before a group of medical students and residents and my new patient. The young man writhing on the stretcher was an African American mechanic from Queens named Jackson, with dark-green eyes and a small Maltese cross tattooed onto his neck. He had been shot, and a large area surrounding the bullet, which was still lodged in his left leg, looked infected. As I peered into jagged edges of the entry wound just above Jackson&#x2019;s knee, a student handed me a piece of paper. The printout revealed the results of microbiological test, which caused my eyes to bulge. My patient, I discovered, was infected with a nimble and aggressive new bacterium that was resistant to every antibiotic at my disposal, except for one: colistin.<br><br>I had used the drug only a few times in my career and never with good results because it was so outrageously toxic. Colistin might kill bacteria, but it destroyed kidneys and other internal organs in the process, leaving many of my patients with just two options: dialysis or death. Antibiotics that had proven so effective just a short time ago were now useless, and if I wanted to save this young man&#x2019;s leg, it was my only option. I shook my head and handed the paper back to my student. &#x201c;Not good.&#x201d; More than twenty thousand people die every year in the United States from antibiotic-resistant infections, and the pipeline of drugs to treat them is always on the verge of drying up. I crouched to meet Jackson&#x2019;s eyes and carefully considered my words. &#x201c;You have an infection,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;A severe infection.&#x201d;<br><br> The man&#x2019;s gaze darted from me to the men and women standing in a horseshoe behind me. &#x201c;How severe?&#x201d; He took in a small breath of air and held it, waiting for me to say something. It felt like an hourglass had been flipped; suddenly the tiny room was very hot. I took off my white coat and rolled up my sleeves. &#x201c;Quite severe.&#x201d;<br><br> His eyebrows raised, and I reflexively extended my arm to hold his hand, but caught myself. I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to touch this patient without protection. I pivoted back to my team. &#x201c;Everybody out. Now.&#x201d; I pointed toward the door. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right back.&#x201d; Just outside of his room, I put on a disposable yellow gown and a pair of purple nitrile gloves, and returned to the bedside alone. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s very hard to treat,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but not impossible.&#x201d; Jackson was now breathing very quickly, on the verge of hyperventilating, as sweat beaded on his forehead. He grasped his thigh, inches above where the bullet had entered. Beneath his fingertips, bacteria were rapidly multiplying, devouring muscle and bone. &#x201c;Am I gonna lose it?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;The leg?&#x201d;<br><br> In truth, I wasn&#x2019;t sure. Only colistin had a chance of destroying the infection, but there were no guarantees. The last person I prescribed it to died twelve hours after she received it. The one before that died while receiving it. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; I said, as confidently as I could. I squeezed his sweaty hand and tried to imagine how I would summarize the nuances of the case for his wife and children. They would need to take&nbsp;special precautions just to be in the same room with him. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to get through this,&#x201d; I said as his eyes began to water. &#x201c;We will.&#x201d;<br><br> I left the room, removed my gown and gloves, and addressed my team. &#x201c;Start colistin,&#x201d; I said. One of the residents frowned as she scurried to a computer to put in the order. Then we vigorously washed our hands and moved on to the next patient.<br><br> When rounds were over, I walked across the hospital to the office of my research collaborator, Tom Walsh, director of the Transplantation-Oncology Infectious Diseases Program. Walsh is a wisp of a man, pale and thin like a potato chip, with deep-set eyes, a warm smile, and a surprisingly firm handshake. His modest features are a notable contrast with my own: I have a high forehead, broad shoulders, and a nose that&#x2019;s slightly too large for my face.<br><br> We make for an odd pair.<br><br> Walsh is one of the world&#x2019;s leading authorities on obscure infections, and when he&#x2019;s not caring for patients, he&#x2019;s creating new antibiotics to treat them. We had met a few years after I graduated from medical school&#x2014;I still have the elegant biochemical structures he drew for me during our first interaction&#x2014;and I&#x2019;ve been working with him ever since. In 2009, he moved from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the federal agency responsible for biomedical research and disease preven- tion. Walsh brought with him an expansive research consortium&#x2014;an international team of physicians and scientists who conduct experiments in test tubes, animals, and humans&#x2014;to develop antibiotics. He is one of the only researchers in the world to oversee a laboratory of this scope; he is an expert in infectious diseases, oncology, pediatrics, internal medicine, pathology, microbiology, and mycology. No one else possesses his breadth of knowledge. Not surprisingly, Big Pharma is eager to work with him. But Tom Walsh does so on his own terms; I once saw him quash a $50 million drug development initiative with three barely audible words: &#x201c;Would not pursue.&#x201d;<br><br> He had called me that October morning in a fit of excitement, with news that Allergan, the pharmaceutical giant, wanted us to run a clinical trial: a large-scale human experiment with an unproven drug. The&nbsp;Dublin-based company was developing a promising new molecule and it wanted us to show it was not only safe but effective in treating humans infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, known colloquially as superbugs. They had become a persistent problem for us; superbugs didn&#x2019;t really exist before the 1960s, and they were only sporadically seen in the world until the 1990s. But a combination of poor prescribing practices by doctors along with the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in commercial agriculture and farming exposed bacteria to our precious arsenal of effective drugs, and the microbes figured out ways to neutralize them. Superbugs were now everywhere&#x2014;even on stray bullets in Queens&#x2014;and they had become a leading cause of deadly infections in humans. &#x201c;So, what is it?&#x201d; I asked Walsh as I entered his office. He leapt up from his messy desk, hurrying past framed diplomas and awards that covered every inch of the mahogany walls, to greet me. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the drug?&#x201d;<br><br> Walsh looked exhausted&#x2014;the man regularly slept only three hours a night&#x2014;because we were in crisis mode, desperately searching for new antibiotics to treat our patients. I had grown accustomed to watching men and women succumb to infections that had been treatable just a few years ago. When Walsh shook my hand, he brightened. &#x201c;Dalbavancin,&#x201d; he said softly.<br><br>My fingers and wrists were still damp from the tense exchange in the emergency room; I wiped them on my khaki pants and sat down in the chair next to his desk. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding.&#x201d;<br> He handed me a thick manila folder. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d;<br><br> Just the word&#x2014;<i>dalbavancin</i>&#x2014;brought me back fourteen years, to my days as an undergraduate tinkering around in the laboratory of a future Nobel laureate named Tom Steitz, a biophysicist who was known around campus as &#x201c;the Michael Jordan of crystallography,&#x201d; the branch of science that probes the atomic building blocks of life. Steitz studied protein synthesis, an essential function of nearly all living things, and his discoveries led to all sorts of new drugs, including a handful of antibiotics related to dalbavancin, called &#x201c;dalba&#x201d; for short. Like Tom Walsh, he was a visionary who could see drug development in ways that others couldn&#x2019;t.<br><br>I connected with Dr. Steitz through his son, Jon, who happened to be my teammate on the Yale University baseball team. He and I were pitchers and biochemistry majors, and we were both drafted out of college to play professional baseball; Jon was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the third round of the 2001 Major League Baseball draft, and I was taken the following year, in the twenty-first round, by the Anaheim Angels. We briefly thought we were destined for the big leagues.<br><br> A year later, after a stint playing minor league baseball in Provo, Utah, I was cut by the Angels and exchanged my baseball mitt for a stethoscope. I enrolled at Harvard Medical School in the fall of 2003, moving to Boston around the time Jon gave up the game and went to Yale Law School. A few weeks after classes began, I attended a lecture by a young and charismatic infectious disease doctor named Paul Farmer, cofounder of the global nonprofit Partners in Health, and immediately knew what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I was going to study infections to learn how to defeat them.<br><br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get to work,&#x201d; Walsh said, snapping me out of my reverie.<br><br> This was the moment everything changed, when I went from a passive observer of drug resistance to an active participant in the race to stop the expanding threat of superbugs. But before I could start the long and winding journey of a clinical trial, I had to familiarize myself with the painful lessons learned from generations of failed studies and appalling ethical lapses, as well as the remarkable scientific advances be- hind the work of Tom Steitz, Tom Walsh, and others. That extraordinary story, the one that ultimately led me into the hospital room of a terrified mechanic from Queens, begins with a different bullet wound one hundred years earlier, in October 1914, when a soft-spoken military physician noticed something unusual and had a hunch. It&#x2019;s an adventure dotted with clues that would help me unravel the mystery of Jackson&#x2019;s infection.</p><h2>A Provocative People: A Secular History of the Jews</h2><p>The Jews are a fascinating people, both to themselves and to everyone else. The Jews are a paradigm of what will happen to most nations and ethnic groups with a long-run exposure to urban global culture. They are an irresistibly global people, a vanguard for the global world. This book dramatizes the transformation of the Jews from a nation dominated by religion to a people overwhelmingly secularized. It is especially interesting because it finds the major contribution of the Jews not in ancient prophets but in modern atheistic intellectuals. In reaction to the Religious Right and Muslim fundamentalism, there is a widespread interest in atheism and secularism. The story of the Jews is a dramatic example of the success of secularism. The militancy of a revived Jewish Orthodoxy is a tribute to this success. For the skeptics of the Biblical and traditional story of the Jews and they are legion this book is a compelling and easily readable alternative history, the culmination of a lifetime of study and insight by one of the most provocative rabbis in Jewish history.</p><p>Sherwin T. Wine (1928-2007) founded Humanistic Judaism as a fifth alternative in Jewish life. A prodigous public intellectual, Wine was the founding rabbi of the Birmingham Temple in suburban Detroit, Michigan, and was instrumental in organizing the Society for Humanistic Judaism, The Center for New Thinking, the North American Committee for Humanism, the Humanist Institute, and the International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism.</p><h2>The Raincoats&#39; The Raincoats (33 1/3)</h2><p><p>In 1979, from the basement of a London squat, the Raincoats reinvented what punk could be.

The great Christian clergymen who wrote before this famous event are referred to as the Ante-Nicenes and the Apostolic Fathers, and their writings are collected here in a ten-volume set. The Ante-Nicenes lived so close to the time of Christ that their interpretations of the New Testament are considered more authentic than modern voices. But they are also real and flawed men, who are more like their fellow Christians than they are like the Apostles, making their words echo in the ears of spiritual seekers. In Volume IV of the 10-volume collected works of the Ante-Nicenes first published between 1885 and 1896, readers will find the writings of: � Tertullian, a Christian apologist and influential Latin Christian thinker � Minucius Felix, known for his dialog Octavius � Commodianus, a Latin poet who converted to Christianity � Origen, a prolific writer and theologian.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Ring Repair</h2><p>Now available, this is the first of six books on jewelry repair based on Revere&#39;s long running series in JCK magazine.

A seasoned fantasy writer with 19 books under his belt, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Sword of Shannara</i>, Brooks began his second career in middle age when he gave up his law practice to pursue writing full time. His move was fueled by an obsession with writing, ("If I don't write, I become restless and ill-tempered"), inspiration from J.R.R. Tolkien, and constant encouragement from publisher Lester del Rey. Some of Brooks's advice is specific and useful, such as the chapter he dedicates to the importance of outlining. However, the lessons he tries to tell through his own adventures tend to be self-serving. Still, Brooks's experiences could be particularly interesting and valuable to fans of his fantasy novels--and aspiring authors of their own. <i>--Lacey Fain</i>In <i>Sometimes the Magic Works</i>, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Terry Brooks shares his secrets for creating unusual, memorable fiction.

Todd Fisher continues his detailed account of the Napoleonic Wars with Austria&#39;s attack against Napoleon in 1809. Despite being defeated at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon rallied his forces and emerged triumphant at Wagram. With glorious victory behind him Napoleon now turned his attention to Russia and invaded in 1812. Yet the army was not the Grand Armee of old, and even the capture of Moscow availed him nothing. The foe remained elusive, the decisive battle remained unfought. This book tells the full story of the now legendary retreat from Moscow, as the fighting force that had vanquished Europe perished in the snows of the Russian winter.</p><p>This unique series studies every major war in history looking at all the aspects of war, from how it felt to be a soldier to the lasting impact of the conflict on the world around it.Todd Fisher is the Executive Director of the Napoleonic Alliance, America&#39;s most prestigious Napoleonic interest group.

His surviving furniture and architectural woodwork still represent the best of nineteenth-century craftsmanship and aesthetics. <br><br>In this lavishly illustrated book, Patricia Phillips Marshall and Jo Ramsay Leimenstoll show how Day plotted a carefully charted course for success in antebellum southern society. Beginning in the 1820s, he produced fine furniture for leading white citizens and in the 1840s and '50s diversified his offerings to produce newel posts, stair brackets, and distinctive mantels for many of the same clients. As demand for his services increased, the technological improvements Day incorporated into his shop contributed to the complexity of his designs. <br><br>Day's style, characterized by undulating shapes, fluid lines, and spiraling forms, melded his own unique motifs with popular design forms, resulting in a distinctive interpretation readily identified to his shop. The photographs in the book document furniture in public and private collections and architectural woodwork from private homes not previously associated with Day. The book provides information on more than 160 pieces of furniture and architectural woodwork that Day produced for 80 structures between 1835 and 1861. <br><br>Through in-depth analysis and generous illustrations, including over 240 photographs (20 in full color) and architectural photography by Tim Buchman, Marshall and Leimenstoll provide a comprehensive perspective on and a new understanding of the powerful sense of aesthetics and design that mark Day's legacy.<br><br></p><p>"Marshall and Leimenstoll have researched Day's remarkable life and work thoroughly, identifying a great quantity of his known and attributed furniture and interior woodwork, finding myriad published sources for his design elements, and examining a wide range of documents to trace his career and describe his world. Their research, along with the wealth of images of Day's unique furniture and interiors, constitutes a book of major, lasting value."--Catherine Bishir, author of <i>North Carolina Architecture</i> <br>Thomas Day (1801-61), a free man of color from Milton, N.C., became the most successful cabinetmaker in North Carolina--white or black--during a time when most blacks were enslaved and free blacks were restricted in their movements and activities.

Plume, meaning feather or pen, is a character who drifts from one thing to another, losing shape, taking new forms, at perpetual risk from reality. He is a personification of the imagination as subject to innumerable pratfalls and disgraces, and yet indestructible for all that. In this new bilingual edition, with translations by Richard Sieburth, the entire Plume cycle appears for the first time in English in the form in which Michaux originally published it.</p><p><b>Henri Michaux</b> (1899&#x2013;1984) was born in Namur, Belgium, and educated at a Jesuit school in Brussels. He contemplated entering the priesthood, turned to medicine, and then, choosing exile instead, enlisted as a seaman in the merchant marine. Michaux&#x2019;s travels in the Americas and Asia<br>inspired his travelogues <i>Ecuador</i> (1929) and <i>A Barbarian in Asia</i> (1933), the latter soon translated by Jorge Louis Borges and Sylvia Beach. Eventually settling in Paris in the 1920s, the expatriate Michaux began to write and paint, and his work drew the attention and praise of influential critics, Andr� Gide and Maurice Blanchot among them. In 1948 Michaux&#x2019;s wife died after accidentally setting her nightgown on fire; devastated, he increasingly devoted himself to distinctive calligraphic drawings. Celebrated around the world for his accomplishments as a writer and artist, Michaux was averse to publicity and public honors and in 1965 refused the French Grand Prix National des Lettres. For many years the only photograph of himself that he allowed to circulate showed his right hand holding a pen over a sheet of paper on a chaotic writing desk.<br><br><b>Richard Sieburth</b> teaches at New York University. His previous versions of Henri Michaux include <i>Emergences/Resurgences</i> and <i>Stroke by Stroke</i>. He has also published translations from the French of Nostradamus, Maurice Sc�ve, Louise Lab�, G�rard de Nerval, Michel Leiris, Antonin Artaud, and Eug�ne Guillevic; and from the German of Oswald von Wolkenstein, Friedrich H�lderlin, Georg Bu&#x308;chner, Walter Benjamin, and Gershom Scholem. He has, in addition, edited a number of Ezra Pound&#x2019;s works.<br><br><b>Lawrence Durrell</b> (1912&#x2013;1990) was a British novelist and travel writer, best known for his Alexandria Quartet.&#x201c;Plume is a modern pilgrim, continually on the quest, in a world which resembles ours but also appears to be the set of a nightmare slapstick. And Plume resembles us as much as he resembles K., Jack Wilton, Charlie Brown, Shuman the Human, the Man Without Qualities, and all those seekers who, when they finally get a chance to address the wise one, are rewarded with a resounding slap in the face.&#x201d; &#x2014;Luc Sante<br><br>&#x201c;Monsieur Plume, the sardonic, off-beat, off-center reflection of his author, a character equally indebted to Charlie Chaplin and Franz Kafka, is back. Sieburth&#x2019;s stunning translation gets all the subtle humor, all the wacky absurdity, and all the tragicomic pathos of Michaux&#x2019;s original. An essential moment in absurdist aesthetics and a sheer delight to read.&#x201d; &#x2014;Cole Swensen</p><h2>The New Human Capital Strategy: Improving the Value of Your Most Important Investment--Year After Year</h2><p>It is often said that the only true source of sustained competitive advantage is people. But what does that mean and how can this be measured and managed? How many organizations know whether their human capital outperforms their competitors&#x2019;, or even whether it improves year-over-year? And what is the strategy for continually improving that performance? The New Human Capital Strategy is a roadmap for delivering measurable business results by systematically improving the performance of those in roles most important to customers and shareholders. Proposing a radical shift in the way organizations measure and manage their people, the book asserts that competitive advantage is a function of four areas of strength: � effective executive teams � leaders who deliver results � outperforming competitors in key positions � workforce performance Using examples, research, and metrics, this essential guide provides readers with a system for ensuring that their people are more valuable this year than the last.</p><p>Bradley W.

He is now head of the consulting firm Hall &amp; Company, Inc. and teaches in Duke University's corporate education program.<p> "The statement 'People are our greatest source of competitive advantage' is hackneyed at best, but still it is true. Author Bradley Hall thinks the main problem is that the leadership in companies doesn&#x2019;t know if their employees are 'better' </p> <p> than their competitor peers and whether they continue to improve annually. He proposes a radical new way of identifying and measuring precisely which activities are most and least responsible for sustained growth, and determining, much the way financial analysis does, which human capital investments will pay dividends over and over. The book maps out a way for HR departments to deliver true business results, and tie human capital initiatives directly and consistently to bottom-line results...The book enables both general managers and HR professionals to create a blueprint of human capital success and a strategy and system for achieving it. In so doing, it calls for 'blowing up' today&#x2019;s HR paradigm and questions many of its assumptions." </p> <p> IHRIM JOURNAL MAGAZINE </p> <br><br> <p> &#x201c;... provides a well-researched, pragmatic approach to developing human talent with a business setting...Recommended.&#x201d; -- Choice magazine </p></p><h2>Bible Doctrine for Older Children, Book A</h2><p><i>Bible Doctrine for Older Children</i> is a two volume series consisting of twenty chapter which contain simple explanations of all major biblical doctrines.

Hotels, motels, and tourist homes are recurring motifs in his work, along with streets, lighthouses, and gas stations forming a visual vocabulary of transportation infrastructure. In ten essays, this fascinating volume explores Hopper&#x2019;s lifelong investigation of such spaces, shedding light on both his professional practice and far-reaching changes in transportation and communications, which affected not only work and leisure but also dynamics of race, class, and gender. Hopper&#x2019;s covers for the trade journal <i>Hotel Management</i>, in addition to other well-known works, invite reflection on the complicated roles of the nascent New Woman; the erasure of hotel work and workers; contemporary associations of the color white with cleanliness and purity; the watercolors Hopper made from hotel windows and rooftops in Mexico; and the broader context of transportation history. A final section traces journeys that Hopper and his wife, the artist Josephine &#x201c;Jo&#x201d; Nivison Hopper, took by car in the 1940s and 1950s; selected correspondence and quotations from Jo&#x2019;s diaries join reproductions of postcards and ephemera illuminating their&#x2014;and fellow Americans&#x2019;&#x2014;shifting travel habits.</p><p>This revealing volume unfolds the layered meanings of a key motif in Edward Hopper&#x2019;s work, exploring the hotel-motel subject as an agent of cultural transformation and emblem of its time.<b>Leo G.

The authors delve into whether Samuel Huntington and Morris Janowitz still ring true in the 21st century; whether training and continuing education play a role in defining a profession; and if there is a universal code of ethics required for the military as a profession. <br><br><i>Redefining the Modern Military</i> is unique in how it treats the subject of ethics and the military profession, as well as the types of writers it brings on board to address this topic. The book puts a significant emphasis on individual agency for military professionalism as opposed to broad organizational or cultural change. Such a review of these topics is necessary because the process of serious, intellectual self-reflection is a requirement--especially in a profession that involves life and death of people and nations.</p><p><b>Nathan K.

That is the book's glory - the perspectives from within that it provides are invaluable. And beyond the chapters' contents the book is doubly important for what it represents: a strong and growing movement within the US military and allied western forces that is agitating for a fresh evaluation of what, exactly, it is to be part of this 'profession of arms'." --<i><b>Defense-in-Depth</b></i><br>"Finney and Mayfield's purpose is to stimulate a dialogue about the military as a profession. They succeed. Redefining the Modern Military is relevant and appropriate reading for today's military professional. This book is interesting, thought provoking, informative, and gives a voice to dissenting opinions about the nature of the military as a profession. The contributors do an excellent job of describing what makes the military a profession and the development of the professional ethos in the military. They also emphasize the importance of education, mentoring, and individual development to the continuance of this professional ethos. Finally, they make a compelling argument that periodic reexamination of the profession, carried out by practitioners, is a defining professional characteristic of the military. Their book is timely, and relevant, and should be added to your professional reading list." <b><i>--Military Review</i></b><br><br>"An awesome example of collaborative writing to elevate the discourse in the profession of arms.

The editing is sharp and consistent. Unlike many collections, it appears the authors saw drafts of all contributors' essays. And while one should never judge a book by its cover, when that cover has blurbs from retired Adm. James Stavridis, former National Security Advisor retired Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster and retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal, and a foreword by former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff retired Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, well, maybe one might want to take a look." <b>--<i>ARMY</i> magazine</b><br><br>"The editors of this volume have done the profession a great service by collecting and refining the ideas in this volume. They have not sought to develop a coherent and consistent assessment of the profession and thus tell us what we should think of its status and future. Rather, they have gathered contributors who disagree with one another without trying to win a debate. Thus, each contributor has added to the conversation in a unique and helpful way and they have collectively reminded military professionals and educators of their responsibility to join them in developing and conveying the profession's expert body of knowledge and ethic." <b><i>--Parameters</i></b><br><br>"<i>Redefining the Modern Military</i> brings together an impressively diverse group of writers to examine military professionalism through many different lenses.

Some fled to protect themselves and their property, while many--most of them women and children--were caught in the crossfire. Surviving the battle was only the beginning. While most history books follow the armies on their journeys away from Gettysburg when the battle receded, <i>Widow of Gettysburg</i> keeps the focus on the aftermath being played out in the town. When the armies withdrew, 21,000 wounded were left in their wake, with only 106 Union medical officers and far fewer Confederate doctors. Women and children were drafted into hospital service, whether they felt confident in their ability or not. Days after the battle's end, thousands more invaded the already overtaxed town in the form of relief workers, sightseers, and those looking for their loved ones. The quiet life they had known was gone.<br><br>Women of Gettysburg did not ask for the distinction, but many became heroines behind the lines just the same. <i>Widow of Gettysburg</i> is the story of their resilience.

And in that spirit of nowness, <i>Great Eastern Sun </i>&#x2014;which is accessible to meditators and nonmeditators alike&#x2014;centers on the question, "Since we're here, how are we going to live from now on?"</p><p>Ch�gyam Trungpa had a vision of a society of enlightened people, or at least of people on the path to enlightenment. These are the Shambhala warriors, people "brave enough not to give in to the aggression and contradictions that exist in society." A companion volume to Trungpa's classic <i>Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior</i>, <i>Great Eastern Sun</i> is an invitation for all people to discover their own goodness, which is always there, just as the sun is always rising. Trungpa had an uncanny grasp of the hang-ups and excuses that keep Westerners in their safe ego cocoons, and in <i>Great Eastern Sun</i> he entices us all out, to express our goodness and live a life on the edge of insecurity. The mindful life turns out to be one of detached but sacred existence, floating with the power of compassionate awareness. A genuine life is what Trungpa propels us to, and <i>Great Eastern Sun</i> is his lantern for guiding us down the path of genuine living. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Ch�gyam Trungpa (1940&#x2013;1987)&#x2014;meditation master, teacher, and artist&#x2014;founded Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, the first Buddhist-inspired university in North America; the Shambhala Training program; and an international association of meditation centers known as Shambhala International.

Tulsa&#39;s Haunted Memories explores the forgotten history and lost folklore of &#34;America&#39;s Most Beautiful City.&#34; Tulsa&#39;s haunting history will captivate the reader with the secrets it holds from its intriguing past. Mystery and mystique follow Tulsa&#39;s urban legends and prove that truth can be stranger than fiction. Once known as the oil capital of the world, its streets were not only lined in &#34;Black Gold,&#34; but also tales of a time when ruthlessness and lawlessness ruled the city. Discover these places and stories that have left their ghostly impressions on Tulsa.</p><p>Author Teri French resides in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, in Tulsa County and is a mother of two boys. Researching Tulsa&#39;s ghostly activity for more than a decade, she has established herself as an authority on local folklore and legend. French has been featured on local and national programs such as The Travel Channel, Discover Oklahoma, Women&#39;s Entertainment, and many others. She filmed a local television series called Haunted Tulsa and had a national television pilot that aired in 2005 named Ghost Moms. She founded Tulsa Spirit Tours in 2002 with a focus to educate the public about Tulsa&#39;s history, promote travel and tourism, and keep the stories alive for future generations.Title: Tulsa's most haunted<br><br>Author: James D. Watts Jr.<br><br>Publisher: World Scene<br><br>Date: 12/15/2010<br>Ghost stories have long been a part of Christmas celebrations -- even getting a mention in "It's the Most Wonderful Time in the World."<br>Tulsan Teri French has been investigating Tulsa's homegrown ghost stories for almost a decade, through her work as leader of the Paranormal Investigation Team of Tulsa and Tulsa Spirit Tours.<br>She's gathered a number of those stories into a new book, "Tulsa's Haunted Memories" (Arcadia, $24.99).<br>French will be discussing Tulsa's spookiest locales and signing copies of her book at an event 11 a.m. Saturday at the Tulsa Historical Society, 2445 S. Peoria Ave.<br>French started working on the book about eight years ago, after she became interested in learning more about those things people claim have gone bump in the night.<br>"It came out of the research that I did for our investigations," French said. "A friend of mine and I started working on it, but we put it away for a while. Then a couple of years ago, I got a call from Arcadia Publishing, which was starting a series of books about haunted places, and they wanted to include Tulsa in the series."<br>Arcadia has published about a dozen books that deal with Tulsa and Northeast Oklahoma history, including "Baseball in Tulsa" and "Tulsa: Where the Streets Were Paved with Gold."<br>French's interest in the paranormal began when she happened to snap a Polaroid image at the place she was working at the time, and captured something she couldn't explain. As she searched, she learned about a group in Oklahoma City that did ghost hunting.<br>"But there wasn't a group in<br>Tulsa doing this, so I decided to start my own," she said. "However, paranormal investigation is a very expensive hobby, so I came up with the idea of doing a 'Spirit Tour' as a way to raise money to buy the equipment we needed."<br>French thought she would do a single tour, but interest was so great that it has become a side business. Tulsa Spirit Tours typically take place in the fall around Halloween.<br>"We'll do tours every weekend in October," she said. "Sometimes, we've started the tours as early as August, and gone into November."<br>All of the places French takes tour patrons to are included in "Tulsa's Haunted Places."<br>"Of course, I go into a lot more detail, and cover a lot more locations, in the book," French said.<br>The book includes chapters on Tulsa mansion, theaters and music venues, local cemeteries, coffee shops and bars, schools, even "Tulsa's Ghostly Suburbs."<br>"I really wrote this book to educate people about the city," French said. "So many cities have ghost tours, and it's a subject that has become extremely popular. I want my book to draw some attention to Tulsa, and show people how cool this city and its history is."<br>Much of the work Teri French and the Paranormal Investigation Team of Tulsa does is to find logical explanations for the unusual things people claim to have seen and heard.<br>"Most of the time, there is a logical explanation for what might seem to be a paranormal phenomenon," French said. "It's very, very rare when we can't find a down-to-earth reason for what's been happening. And those are the times that give us all a thrill."<br>Some of the places where French and her team found such a thrill are:<br>The Gilcrease House: "By far, this is the most haunted place, to go by the number of things experienced by a number of very credible people. It's one of the few places the team decided to leave early because of what we experienced there."<br>Woodward Park: "We've heard a whole lot of odd stories about unexplained things people have experienced here."<br>The building at the corner of Main and Brady Streets, formerly Lola's: "It's sad that place is closed now, because there were some fascinating things there."<br>Other locales with a deservedly spooky reputation are The Brady Theater, the Tulsa Garden Center and Tulsa Little Theater.</p><h2>Strong-Willed Child or Dreamer?</h2><p>Your child may be a sensitive dreamer if: he forgets to follow instructions, no matter how clear and simple, she craves praise and positive attention, yet refuses to conform to what&#39;s expected, he tells more than his share of fibs and tall tales. If you recognize these actions in your child, you know the frustration of turning to parenting experts for advice only to find the systems don&#39;t work, the rules don&#39;t stick and strong boundary setting makes the situation worse. The creative-sensitive dreamer is not the strong-willed child. Get this book and learn how to parent your special needs child who is principle -oriented rather than rule-oriented, highly creative, overly sensitive and frustrated at a world that fails to live up to the ideal.</p><p></p><h2>By the People: Rebuilding Liberty Without Permission</h2><p><p><b>The American way of life, built on individual liberty and limited government, is on life support.</b></p><p>American freedom is being gutted. Whether we are trying to run a business, practice a vocation, raise our families, cooperate with our neighbors, or follow our religious beliefs, we run afoul of the government&#x2014;not because we are doing anything wrong but because the government has decided it knows better. When we object, that government can and does tell us, &#x201c;Try to fight this, and we&#x2019;ll ruin you.&#x201d;</p><p>In this provocative book, acclaimed social scientist and bestselling author Charles Murray shows us why we can no longer hope to roll back the power of the federal government through the normal political process. The Constitution is broken in ways that cannot be fixed even by a sympathetic Supreme Court. Our legal system is increasingly lawless, unmoored from traditional ideas of &#x201c;the rule of law.&#x201d;&nbsp;The legislative process has become systemically corrupt no matter which party is in control.</p><p>But there&#x2019;s good news beyond the Beltway. Technology is siphoning power from sclerotic government agencies and putting it in the hands of individuals and communities. The rediversification of American culture is making local freedom attractive to liberals as well as conservatives. People across the political spectrum are increasingly alienated from a regulatory state that nakedly serves its own interests rather than those of ordinary Americans.</p><p>The even better news is that federal government has a fatal weakness: It can get away with its thousands of laws and regulations only if the overwhelming majority of Americans voluntarily comply with them. Murray describes how civil disobedience backstopped by legal defense funds can make large&nbsp;portions of the 180,000-page Federal Code of Regulations unenforceable, through a targeted program that identifies regulations that arbitrarily and capriciously tell us what to do. Americans have it within their power to make the federal government an insurable hazard like hurricanes and floods, leaving us once again free to live our lives as we see fit.<br><br>By the People&#x2019;s hopeful message is that rebuilding our traditional freedoms does not require electing a right-thinking Congress or president, nor does it require five right-thinking justices on the Supreme Court. It can be done by we the people, using America&#x2019;s unique civil society to put government back in its proper box.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Charles Murray</b> is the W. H.

It is simultaneously depressing and inspiring, technical and profound, infuriating and charming, but always compelling. Charles Murray plays the role of a liberty-loving Lenin asking the question, 'What is to be done?' To this end, he offers a practical guide to repairing our broken constitutional order. It is that rarest of books: a populist manifesto grounded in fact and logic." --Jonah Goldberg<br><br>"A road map to recapture true American exceptionalism. With passion, brilliance, and a keen sense of the radical essence of what America means, Murray dismisses what passes for political debate today and offers an audacious plan to restore the liberty our founders bequeathed to us." -- Edward Crane, president emeritus, Cato Institute<br><br>"Liberty without permission? Selective civil disobedience? I'm in! At first I balked, but Murray makes a convincing case that a Madison Fund might scrape away the sclerosis of the suffocating state. As usual, his original arguments expand the way I think. When law is so complex that it's indistinguishable from lawlessness, when the tax code is 4 million words long, something like systematic disobedience is badly needed." --John Stossel</p><h2>Radiant Terminus</h2><p><p>"Irreducible to any single literary genre, the Volodinian cosmos is skillfully crafted, fusing elements of science fiction with magical realism and political commentary."&#x2015; <i>Music &amp; Literature</i></p><p>The most patently sci-fi work of Antoine Volodine's to be translated into English, <i>Radiant Terminus </i>takes place in a Tarkovskian landscape after the fall of the Second Soviet Union.

Caetlin Benson-Allot looks back on the remote control's material and cultural history to explain how such an innocuous media accessory has changed the way we occupy our houses, interact with our families, and experience the world. From the first wired radio remotes of the 1920s to infrared universal remotes, from the homemade TV controllers to the Apple Remote, remote controls shape our media devices and how we live with them.</p><p>Object Lessons is published in partnership with an essay series in the The Atlantic.</p></p><p><p><b>Caetlin Benson-Allott </b>is Associate Professor of English at Georgetown University, USA.

It's ubiquitous but easy to misplace. An essential convenience but still an overly complicated nuisance.

Filled with fascinating details and conveyed in sharp, accessible prose, the books make the everyday world come to life.

When her ex asks to take the children to meet his new fianc�e's family, Josie makes a run for it to Alaska with her kids, Paul and Ana. At first their trip feels like a vacation: they see bears and bison, they eat hot dogs cooked on a bonfire, and they spend nights parked along icy cold rivers in dark forests. But as they drive in their rattling old RV, pushed north by the ubiquitous wildfires, Josie is chased by enemies both real and imagined, and past mistakes pursue her tiny family, even to the very edge of civilization.

The happiness of being alone, and tipsy on red wine, in the passenger seat of an ancient recreational vehicle parked somewhere in Alaska&#x2019;s deep south, staring into a scribble of black trees, afraid to go to sleep for fear that at any moment someone will get past the toy lock on the RV door and murder you and your two small children sleeping above.<br> &nbsp;<br> Josie squinted into the low light of a long summer evening at a rest stop in southern Alaska. She was happy this night, with her pinot, in this RV in the dark, surrounded by unknown woods, and became less afraid with every new sip from her yellow plastic cup. She was content, though she knew this was a fleeting and artificial contentment, she knew this was all wrong&#x2014;she should not be in Alaska, not like this. She had been a dentist and was no father of her children, an invertebrate, a loose-boweled man named Carl, a man who had told Josie marriage-by-documentation was a sham, the paper superfluous and reductive, had, eighteen months after he&#x2019;d moved out, found a different woman to marry him. He&#x2019;d met and now was, improbably, impossibly, marrying some other person, a person from Florida. It was happening in September, and Josie was fully justified in leaving, in disappearing until it was all over. Carl had no idea she had taken the children out of Ohio. Almost out of North America. And he could not know. And what could better grant her invisibility than this, a rolling home, no fixed address, a white RV in a state with a million other wayward travelers, all of them in white RVs? No one could ever find her. She&#x2019;d contemplated leaving the country altogether, but Ana didn&#x2019;t have a passport and Carl was needed to get one, so that option was out. Alaska was at once the same country but another country, was almost Russia, was almost oblivion, and if Josie left her phone and used only cash&#x2014;she&#x2019;d brought three thousand dollars in the kind of velvet bag meant to hold gold coins or magic beans&#x2014;she was untraceable, untrackable. And she&#x2019;d been a Girl Scout. She could tie a knot, gut a fish, start a fire. Alaska did not daunt her.<br> &nbsp;<br> She and the kids had landed in Anchorage earlier that day, a grey day without promise or beauty, but the moment she&#x2019;d stepped off the plane she found herself inspired. &#x201c;Okay guys!&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said to her exhausted, hungry children. They had never expressed any interest in Alaska, and now here they were. &#x201c;Here we are!&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said, and she&#x2019;d done a celebratory little march. Neither child smiled.&nbsp;<br><br>.......</p><h2>Masses and Motets (Dover Choral Music Scores)</h2><p><p>Despite his vast output (105 masses, over 250 motets), Giovanni de Palestrina (c. 1525&#x2013;1594) maintained an extraordinary level of quality in his music. With Byrd and Lassus, he ranks among the greatest composers of the last sixteenth century and a study of his work is essential for serious students and scholars.<br>This volume contains six masses by the composer, as well as a selection of motets. Certain of the masses are "parody" masses, i.e. they are based on a motet or other works by Palestrina or another composer. In such cases, the original motet, or chant, has also been included here. The six masses are: <i>Missa Papae Marcelli</i> (his most famous), <i>Missa L'Homme Arm�</i>, <i>Missa O Magnum Mysterian</i> (plus motet), <i>Missa Ave Regina Coelorum</i> (plus chant), <i>Missa Veni Sponsa Christi</i> (plus motet), and <i>Missa Ascendo ad Patrem</i> (plus motet). Written for unaccompanied voices, these compositions rank among the finest works of a towering figure in early music. In this inexpensive, authoritative edition, they will be welcomed by all students and lovers of sacred music.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Paganini&#39;s Ghost (Gianni and Guastafeste, 2) (Volume 2)</h2><p>It&#39;s the most exciting concert Cremona has seen in years: a brilliant young Russian playing a violin once owned by the 19th-century master Nicolo Paganini. But the performance is overshadowed by the murder of one of its sponsors. Solving the murder will require a journey into musical history; to make that journey, Cremona&#39;s police-chief will need the help of Gianni Castiglione, an elderly charmer and only mildly larcenous expert in violins.</p><p><p>PAUL ADAM grew up in the north of England and studied law at Nottingham University. He began his writing career as a journalist and has worked in Rome as well as England. He is the author&nbsp;of&nbsp;<i>The&nbsp;Rainaldi Quartet. </i>He lives in Sheffield, England, with his wife and two children.</p><p>One</p><p>Over the half a century that I have been working as a violin maker and repairer, I have had instruments brought to me in many different ways. Most were nothing out of the ordinary&#x2014;a musician simply turning up at my workshop with a violin in a case&#x2014;but one or two have been more remarkable.</p><p>There was the Guadagnini, discovered under a pile of wooden crates in a hayloft near Bergamo, that was delivered to me wrapped in newspaper and an old potato sack. Then there was the famous, but decidedly eccentric, international virtuoso, whom discretion forbids me from naming, who showed up on my doorstep one day with his Stradivari nestling in the bottom of a supermarket carrier bag. Perhaps most extraordinary of all was the Amati belonging to a well-known Italian soloist, which his wife&#x2014;a neglected, highly strung woman, tired of playing second fiddle to a piece of wood&#x2014;had smashed over his head during a particularly violent marital argument. The soloist filed an assault charge against his&#x2014;soon to be ex-&#x2014;spouse, and several months later the violin, or, rather, the bits of it, being Exhibit A in the prosecution case, were conveyed to me for repair in eight separate police evidence bags.</p><p>But none of these events, bizarre though they were, were quite so memorable as the one that was now unfolding before me.</p><p>There were six vehicles in the convoy. I had been telephoned half an hour earlier to be given advance warning of its arrival, so I was waiting outside my house when the procession appeared on the horizon, speeding towards me along the road from Cremona. At the front was a blue-and-white police patrol car with its roof light flashing, but its siren mercifully silent&#x2014;a show of restraint not normally associated with the Italian police. Behind the patrol car was a shiny dark blue Alfa Romeo with tinted windows, followed by a black armoured van like the ones banks use for delivering cash to their branches. Fourth in the line was a red Fiat Bravo, then a silver Mercedes saloon. Bringing up the rear was a second marked police car.</p><p>I had never seen anything like it. My home is relatively isolated, a former farmhouse surrounded by fields of maize and potatoes. The nearest house is a good kilometre away. I usually enjoy the privacy the location affords me, but today, for once, I was sorry that I didn&#x2019;t have any closer neighbours who could share in this curious spectacle. Such an ostentatious convoy seemed wasted on me alone.</p><p>The first police car skidded to a halt just past the entrance to the gravel forecourt at the front of my house, the driver indulging a worrying penchant for exhibitionism by braking heavily and slewing his vehicle round so that it blocked the carriageway. Two scruffy uniformed officers climbed out, both sporting the mirror sunglasses, stubble, and institutional truculence that seem to be de rigueur in the Polizia Nazionale.</p><p>The two vehicles immediately behind&#x2014;the Alfa Romeo and the armoured van&#x2014;turned off the road onto the forecourt and stopped beside me. Two men got out of the Alfa Romeo. They were so similar in appearance that they could have been twins. Their smart black suits, white shirts, and highly polished black shoes were identical. Even their ties, a silvery grey silk with a black diamond pattern, were the same. They were in their late twenties, wearing mirror sunglasses like the police officers, but a class apart in every other respect&#x2014;sleek, well-fed leopards to the policemen&#x2019;s mangy alley cats. With their discreet but stylish clothes, their alert manner&#x2014;heads constantly moving, eyes searching for possible threats&#x2014;and the walkie-talkies clutched in their hands, they looked like the bodyguards you always see accompanying the U.S. president or other heads of state. And I suppose bodyguards is what they were, only the body they were guarding was made of maple and pine, rather than flesh and blood.</p><p>"You are Giovanni Battista Castiglione?" one of them asked me curtly.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>"Your workshop is where?"</p><p>"Round the back, in the garden," I said.</p><p>"Show me."</p><p>I led him down the side of the house to the old farm smithy that I have converted into my workshop. His companion remained at the front, but the two men kept in contact by walkie-talkie.</p><p>"One-storey brick building, set apart from the house," the bodyguard murmured into his radio. "Garden"&#x2014;his eyes scanned my lawn and flower beds&#x2014;"large, open. Good visibility. No perimeter barrier. Fields beyond." His gaze came back to me. "Let&#x2019;s see inside."</p><p>He studied the heavy wooden door and sturdy lock approvingly as I opened up the workshop, relaying his findings to his colleague. Then he inspected the interior of the room, checking the windows first before turning his attention to the workbench and cupboards.</p><p>"That&#x2019;s a safe?" he asked, staring at the steel door set into the recess that had once been a hearth.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Looks pretty solid."</p><p>"I handle a lot of valuable instruments," I said.</p><p>He prowled round the table in the centre of the room and opened a couple of cupboards warily, as if he were expecting some assailant&#x2014;presumably a very small one&#x2014;to leap out and attack him. Then he raised the walkie-talkie to his lips again.</p><p>"Okay, it&#x2019;s secure. I&#x2019;m coming back now."</p><p>We returned to the front of the house, where a small group of people had gathered&#x2014;the occupants of the Fiat and the Mercedes, which had been obliged to park on the verge at the side of the road because there was no room for them on the forecourt. A diminutive man in a grey suit and rimless spectacles stepped forward and held out his hand.</p><p>"Dottor Castiglione, it&#x2019;s a pleasure to meet you. I am Enrico Golinelli, assistant curator of antiquities for the city of Genoa."</p><p>I took his hand in mine. His fingers felt so slight and fragile that I hardly dared squeeze them.</p><p>"I apologise for the short notice," Golinelli went on. "It is most kind of you to help us."</p><p>"Not at all," I replied. "I&#x2019;m honoured that you asked me."</p><p>"Nothing like this has ever happened before. I don&#x2019;t know what it can be. The instrument was checked over thoroughly before it left Genoa. But Signor Ivanov is absolutely sure that . . ." Golinelli paused. "Forgive me, I&#x2019;m forgetting my manners."</p><p>He turned away from me and gestured at the man and woman standing next to him.</p><p>"Allow me to introduce Yevgeny Ivanov, and his mother, Ludmilla Ivanova."</p><p>Ludmilla Ivanova offered me her hand. I didn&#x2019;t hesitate to clasp it firmly in my own. There was nothing delicate about her fingers, or her grip. There was nothing delicate about any of her, in fact. She was a big woman, tall and statuesque, with thick black hair pulled back and fastened with a clasp at the nape of her neck. She was wearing red high heels and a scarlet-and-black knee-length dress that was perhaps a shade too low-cut for her mature years, but she had the figure, and the confidence, to carry it off. Her build, the strong, determined set of her jaw reminded me of a Wagnerian soprano and I wondered whether she had been an opera singer once. When she spoke, her voice, too, had the powerful resonance of a Br�nnhilde.</p><p>"Dottore, I&#x2019;ve heard much about you," she said in fluent Italian, the words muddied round the edges by her strong Russian accent. "They say you are good, the best luthier in Cremona."</p><p>I inclined my head modestly, but she was not expecting a reply.</p><p>"I hope they are right," she continued. "We are in urgent need of your expertise. Whatever is wrong, you must fix it. My son&#x2019;s recital is only hours away."</p><p>She glanced at the young man beside her. He gave me a shy nod, then seemed to shrink away, retreating into his mother&#x2019;s shadow. He was shorter than Ludmilla and much thinner. His face had a gaunt look that was accentuated by his high cheekbones and deep-set dark eyes, and though his shoulders were broad and his bone structure robust, there was so little flesh on him, he appeared painfully emaciated.</p><p>"People are expecting to hear this instrument," Ludmilla said. "Without it, the recital will not be the same. We shall have to cancel."</p><p>"Let us not be premature, signora," Golinelli said, breaking in quickly. "The problem may be easily solved. I suggest we proceed immediately, if our escort from the insurance company will permit it."</p><p>Golinelli turned to the two bodyguards.</p><p>"Gentlemen?"</p><p>"Everything appears to be in order," one of the young men said.</p><p>"Then let us get on."</p><p>The bodyguards signalled to the driver of the armoured van, who nodded and put on his crash helmet and thick, padded protective vest before climbing out and walking round to the rear of the vehicle. The rest of us gathered round to watch him open the doors. There were twelve of us&#x2014;me, the two bodyguards from the insurance company, Ludmilla and Yevgeny Ivanov and a nondescript-looking man whom I took to be their driver, Golinelli, a young woman with a severe academic face who had to be the assistant curator&#x2019;s assistant, and the four police officers who had strolled over from their cars to see what all the fuss was about.</p><p>The insurance company escorts weren&#x2019;t happy about that. This was their show. They didn&#x2019;t want the local cops muscling in on it. One of the bodyguards glared at the policemen and said sharply, "You&#x2019;re supposed to be watching the road."</p><p>The police officers nodded indifferently, their eyes hidden behind their sunglasses, but they didn&#x2019;t move. They weren&#x2019;t going to take orders from a civilian in an Armani suit.</p><p>"Okay?" the van driver said. His voice was soft, muffled by the Perspex visor of his crash helmet.</p><p>The bodyguards took a last look round, scrutinising the forecourt, the road, the fields.</p><p>"Okay, go ahead."</p><p>The van driver inserted a key into the lock, turned it, and swung open the heavy armour-plated doors. The watching group&#x2014;me included&#x2014;edged forward, necks craning to see into the interior.</p><p>It was something of an anticlimax. At first sight, the van appeared empty&#x2014;just bare walls and a large vacant cavity. Then the eye was drawn down to the floor, to a web of straps and buckles that were holding something in place. In the centre of the web&#x2014;looking very small and insignificant&#x2014;was a rather shabby rectangular violin case.</p><p>The driver climbed inside the van, unfastened the straps carefully, and picked up the case by its handle. He passed it to one of the insurance company men, lowered himself back down to the ground, then took the case back.</p><p>Quietly, without needing to be given instructions, we somehow organised ourselves into a rough line. The bodyguards were at the front, the van driver sandwiched between them; then came Golinelli and the Ivanovs. I was next, just ahead of Golinelli&#x2019;s assistant and the Ivanovs&#x2019; driver. The four police officers clustered at the rear and, like mourners at a funeral, we all processed solemnly round to my workshop.</p><p>Everything about the occasion&#x2014;the policemen, the bodyguards, the armoured van&#x2014;seemed so over the top that I was almost inclined to laugh. But the precautions were understandable, for this was no ordinary violin we were escorting. This was a Guarneri "del Ges�"&#x2014;the most valuable, famous Guarneri del Ges� on earth. This was il Cannone&#x2014;the Cannon&#x2014;the violin that had belonged to Nicol� Paganini.</p><p></p><p>Excerpted from Paganini&#x2019;s Ghost by Paul Adam.<br>Copyright � 2009 by Paul Adam.<br>Published in January 2010 by Minotaur Books.<br>All rights reserved.

She has called upon other writers, editors, and publishers to add their voices to this treasury of assistance for budding writers and a refreshing dose of encouragement for longtime scribes. And once you are ready, an appendix offers of writing awards and competitions and a selection of websites and literary journals.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive Excerpt from <em>Maeve Binchy's Writers' Club</em>: Finding Your Voice</strong><p></p> <p></p> I never knew what was meant by "finding your voice." Not for ages. But I think I know now. I believe it means finding a way to write that is comfortable for you. It&#x2019;s finding the method to tell your story that seems natural and unaffected. That way you're not going to get caught out all the time trying to keep up with some kind of style that you think may be appropriate.<p></p> We should think of Shaw's <i>Pygmalion</i>, in which the cockney girl can pronounce "the rain in Spain" perfectly, but comes totally unstuck in a moment of crisis. I know people in Ireland who have changed their accents considerably, and I have an unworthy wish to wake them in the middle of the night with the news that their house is on fire just to hear if they cry, "Jaysus," like the rest of us. I think that finding a voice in writing has everything to do with integrity and little to do with stylistic imitation. If we admire someone a lot, then it's tempting to think that if we, too, wrote like that we would be terrific. Not necessarily so--we could end up just looking like poor copies.<p></p> I adore William Trevor's writing; I would <i>love</i> to be able to create a relationship, a family, a community, a sense of tension as he does. But there's no point in trying to imitate him; I&#x2019;d fall flat on my face. Instead, I read him with awe, and I wonder if there is any trick or writing technique he has that I might somehow "borrow." I have been to talks he has given and even asked questions from the audience, and I have learned a lot.<p></p> One thing he says is that if you have several characters and set ups in a story, the trick is to move on fairly quickly from one to the other. If you are starting to get bored by a scene, you can be sure that the reader would be bored a page ago. Move on, he says, and it's great advice.<p></p> He also suggests leaving a short story in a drawer and not looking at it for six months. That, I am afraid, would be a total nonstarter for me. The moment I have "The End" written, the story is in an envelope or an e-mail to someone. But in a perfect world William Trevor may be right when he says that if you let a story settle for six months you can see all the mistakes as if they were highlighted in yellow Day-Glo. Yes, but suppose you saw the whole story highlighted? What would you do then?<p></p> The point of all this is: what do we get from other writers? My bossy advice is that you don't want to <i>copy</i> other writers; what you want is to "borrow" some of their techniques and present them in your own voice. It&#x2019;s no use asking any writer, "Where do you get your ideas?" Oddly, it's the question writers are asked most often, and it's almost impossible to answer in any way helpfully. You get your ideas by asking yourself what kind of situation you would be happy to sit down and write about every single week for seven or eight months. Usually it&#x2019;s something you feel comfortable with, like something from your own experience or from familiar territory. Or it could be something that fascinates you, for example, if you were interested in military history and were going to write a historical novel set at the Battle of the Bulge.<p></p> My most fervent suggestion is, don't allow yourself to believe that if a topic worked for one person it will work for you. That way you are denying yourself the real pleasure of writing, which is telling your own story in your own way. There are loads of hints out there, and I have always found writers are willing to share them rather than hug the secrets of success to themselves.<p></p> There will always be plenty of readers keen for things to read. Success is not a pie where everyone who gets a slice has somehow diminished what is left for everyone else. That&#x2019;s not really how it works. Success is more like a cairn, a heap of stones where the more each person gets, the more it adds to the general body of work out there. Other writers are there to encourage us, to be the living proof that those hours of "keeping at it" can pay off. If we can learn a little hint here and there from every writer we read, and even more especially, from every writer we meet, then we will do well.<p></p> --<i>Maeve</i><p></p>Maeve Binchy is the author of numerous bestselling books, including <i>Whitethorn Woods</i>, <i>Nights of Rain and Stars</i>, <i>Quentins</i>, <i>Scarlet Feather</i>, <i>Circle of Friends</i>, and <i>Tara Road</i>, which was an Oprah&#x2019;s Book Club Selection.

The maverick author of Change Your Brain, Change Your Life and Healing ADD now presents his proven program for repairing and strengthening our relationships, child-rearing practices, work and study routines, and, ultimately, our soulful connections, in the deepest ways possible. Guided by this book, each of us can learn to balance and optimize the parts of the brain responsible for inner growth, intimacy, and spiritual health. Drawing upon his experience with over fourteen thousand brain-imaging studies of patients from all walks of life, Dr. Amen has developed an essential tool called the Amen Brain System Checklist, a 101-question self-test used to evaluate the five brain systems that are key to achieving and maintaining a healthy brain-soul connection. The questionnaire identifies the problem brain areas readers may need to work on, offers insight into the degree to which these imbalances affect their lives, and provides targeted strategies for each area of the brain involved with spiritual issues. These are just a few of the many &#34;brain prescriptions&#34; to be found in Healing the Hardware of the Soul: Develop focus and improve decision-making with the One-Page Miracle for the Soul Use prayer, meditation, and diaphragmatic breathing exercises for superior emotional and spiritual flexibility Heal painful deep soul memories through thought and behavior exercises Learn how forming strong, positive new bonds actually controls impulsive behavior and stabilizes mood swings Dr. Amen&#39;s recommendations include cutting-edge advice on diet, nutritional supplements, and the judicious use of medication when needed. He also explains which medications can unbalance the brain when used improperly. Dramatic before-and-after pictures of the brain demo</p><p><b>Daniel G.

They both need to work together in order to make beautiful music.</i><br><br> -- FATHER CHARLES ARA, CATHOLIC PRIEST<br><br>Josey experienced a living hell. Not as a far-off place where people burn for unforgiven sins, but in her everyday life. Josey suffered from panic disorder, the most common psychiatric disorder in the United States. It began in her early twenties. She worried constantly, saw the future as negative and frightening, and endured many anxiety attacks. The attacks, which came on suddenly, were associated with crushing chest pain, her heart pounding hard against her chest wall; she also had trouble catching her breath, and she felt that something terrible was about to happen. The attacks made her hide from the world. They came in waves, eight to ten in a month, and then months with none at all. They were unpredictable. Her life started to revolve around the fear of attacks. She dropped out of college after her sophomore year, stopped driving, stopped seeing her boyfriend, and worked at home doing transcription so that she would not have to go out unaccompanied. She did not seek help for years for fear of being labeled crazy.<br><br>Josey prayed to God for deliverance from the anxiety attacks. As a child she had felt close to God and prayed every night before bed. Like many young adults, she had drifted away from her prayers but had still believed in a loving, present God, as her parents had taught her. When the attacks first occurred, she prayed many times a day that God would take this curse from her. Over time, as the anxiety attacks persisted, she prayed less and finally stopped. She became angry at God, and wondered why He was punishing her with the attacks. On several occasions the attacks were so bad that she contemplated suicide. When her parents heard about her suicidal ideas, they forced her to see me because I had helped her cousin with similar problems.<br><br>The day I met Josey I thought this young woman was in hell -- years of torture and torment from her anxiety disorder and disconnection from her friends, her work, her future, and even her God. Many theologians believe that hell is disconnection from God. The illness had caused Josey to lose herself, her relationship with God, and nearly her life.<br><br>As part of Josey's evaluation, I ordered a brain SPECT study -- an amazing test that examines how the brain works. Josey's scan showed a number of "hot spots," overactive areas, in the part of the brain that generates fear and anxiety. Seeing the physiological problem in her brain for herself was the first step in the healing process that would unfold over the next several months. Rather than thinking that she had a moral, character, or personality problem, she now accepted the fact that she had a medical illness needing treatment. The treatment involved medication, prayer and meditation, and targeted mental exercises. Over time, she successfully rebuilt her life. She was able to travel unaccompanied to work; she fell in love, married, had children, and made peace with God. Josey's brain, the hardware of her soul, all that she was inside, had been ill, a fact that caused everything else in her life to suffer. Helping her brain allowed her to once again have access to her soul, her real self, and even her God.<br><br>Josey's SPECT Study<br><br>The white color indicates the areas of greatest brain activity. A healthy scan shows white in the back of the brain only (cerebellum). Josey's brain shows white or hot areas in the emotional and anxiety centers of her brain.<br><br>The word "soul" as translated from Old Testament Hebrew means "all of your thoughts, feelings, personality characteristics, self, desires, and passions." The soul is who we are inside, from the top of our head to the bottom of our feet. The soul is felt and translated into action through the day-to-day function of the brain. William Shakespeare said, "The brain is the soul's fragile dwelling place." We can now see actual evidence of this brain-soul connection through the latest brain-imaging techniques. These studies have so clearly taught me that <i>when the brain is healthy we are compassionate, thoughtful, loving, relaxed, and goal directed, and when the brain is sick or damaged we are unfeeling, impulsive, angry, tense, and unfocused, and it is very hard for our souls and our relationship with God to be at peace.</i><br><br>In my previous books <i>Change Your Brain, Change Your Life</i> and <i>Healing ADD,</i> I use my work with the latest brain-imaging science to teach readers about brain-behavioral problems like anxiety, depression, impulsiveness, obsession, anger, and attention deficit disorder. Through images of the brain the books show that behavioral problems are often related to brain dysfunction and are not the result of a weak will or a character defect. <i>Healing the Hardware of the Soul</i> builds upon these books by helping you understand and enhance the connection between brain function and your innermost being, your soul. <br><br><b>Brain-Soul Feedback Loop</b><br><br>This book will teach you how to harness the positive energy at work in the powerful feedback loop between brain function and the condition of your soul. A healthy soul actually enhances brain function, and a healthy brain is essential to a healthy soul.<br><br>Like the hardware of a computer, the brain must function at an optimal level in order to run the software programs of life (daily activities like child rearing, teaching and learning, going through adolescence, training for a career, intimate relationships, navigating midlife crises). When a computer does not have enough RAM (random-access memory), speed, or storage space, it cannot run its software programs efficiently. Similarly, a brain that isn't running at optimal efficiency will have trouble keeping a life and soul on track.<br><br>As with computers, you need more than hardware to live a full and authentic life. The hardware of a computer is powerless without an efficient operating system or proper software. So too in our lives, we need effective programming -- good parenting, optimal nutrition, positive relationships, freedom from chronic stress, clear goals, positive thoughts, and an attitude of gratefulness -- in order for the brain to work right. <i>A dynamic feedback loop exists between the brain and the events of our lives. The brain impacts our behavior, and how we behave impacts actual brain function.</i> Our latest research has shown that thoughts, feelings, and social interactions all impact brain function in potentially positive and negative ways.<br><br>The brain-soul connection is involved in everything we do. Understanding it will lead to a deeper knowledge of our most intimate selves and help us to explain human triumphs and failures. This connection will help us understand:<br><br>� good (it is likely that Mother Teresa and Mahatma Gandhi had optimal brain function),<br><br>� evil (it is also likely that Adolf Hitler and other brutal dictators had faulty brain wiring, despite being able to rise to power),<br><br>� sin (in the New Testament the Greek word for sin is <i>hermatia,</i> or quite simply, "missing the mark," which is quite easy to do with poor brain function),<br><br>� love (couples who thrive likely have more optimal brain patterns than those who struggle),<br><br>� hate (in my clinical experience, many racists have abnormal brain patterns), and<br><br>� child abuse (often at the hands of people with brain problems).<br><br>I have seen firsthand at the Amen Clinics how many people are searching desperately for a more fulfilling, meaningful, peaceful, hopeful, positive life, who want to live, love, and feel connected to something. Instead, many feel depressed, angry, lonely, unhappy, and disconnected. The clinically based brain-soul healing techniques included in this book will help you optimize your brain and improve your relationships, work, and spiritual connections in the deepest ways possible.<br><br><i>But what do I know about the soul?</i> Isn't soul work off target for a brain scientist? Let me put these ideas into the context of my own life. I grew up in a very religious Roman Catholic Lebanese home, with five sisters and a brother. I attended Catholic school until the end of ninth grade, and was an altar boy for many years. I was taught very clear ideas of right and wrong, good and evil, heaven and hell, and the judgment day. These beliefs followed me into my adult life.<br><br>During the Vietnam War, I had a very low draft number and went into the U.S. Army, where I was trained to be a combat medic. I was fortunate enough to be sent to Germany rather than Vietnam. In Germany, as a lonely soldier, I met Christine, a pretty, petite company clerk. She asked me to go to a church service with her. It turned out to be an Assembly of God Pentecostal Church service, with shouting, praying in tongues, and long, intense healing sessions. At first I felt strange, especially with all of the noise in church. As a Roman Catholic, I was used to church being a quiet place. Not this church! There was a lot of intense emotional expression, but also a lot of fellowship and worship. I met some wonderful people and became actively involved with Teen Challenge, a Christian group that worked with drug addicts, which was one of the factors leading to my interest in psychiatry. Many of the addicts had failed traditional drug-treatment programs but were able to rid themselves of their addictions when they developed a deep faith and a connection with God. It was a fascinating process to watch.<br><br>After three years in Germany, I was discharged from the military and attended Orange Coast College for a year and then Vanguard University, an Assembly of God Bible college in Southern California. I studied biology and the Bible. I wanted to be a doctor, but I also wanted a solid spiritual foundation for my life. Nothing in the Bible dissuaded me from medicine, and nothing in my biological studies challenged my faith. In 1978, I had the good fortune to be accepted into the charter class of Oral Roberts University (ORU) School of Medicine. Minister and faith healer Oral Roberts had worked hard to bring together spiritual healing and medical healing, a concept that I felt could be extremely powerful. I was suspicious that they accepted me because of my last name: The first graduate from their medical school would be Dr. "Amen."<br><br>ORU was an amazing place to attend medical school. We were taught solid medical science in an atmosphere of love, compassion, and prayer. It was different from every other medical school in the country. We were taught how to pray with patients, take spiritual histories, and consider the "mind, body, and spirit" in treating the whole person. In a number of classes we struggled with the issue of sin and sickness. Many fundamentalist Christians believe that physical or emotional sickness comes from a sick soul, and that you are more likely to be physically or emotionally sick if you have sin in your life. Others feel that we all get sick and die -- it is part of the human condition. It only causes people to struggle with unnecessary guilt when you blame their illnesses on sin. It was a sticky and complex issue.<br><br>After medical school, I did my psychiatric internship and residency at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., the military's largest hospital. As a resident, I taught a class to physicians and chaplains on the connection between medicine and spirituality. I taught that 70 percent of the people in the United States have strong fundamental religious beliefs, and that health-care professionals, ministers, and rabbis needed to work together for the best interests of their patients. With each year of medical training and experience it became obvious to me that there were many missing pieces to the puzzle of spirituality and healing. During my residency I found that the more patients were connected to their religious faith, whether Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Buddhist, or Muslim, the healthier they seemed to be as a whole. They tended to need fewer psychiatric visits than those who were not connected to a body of believers. Researchers at Harvard, Duke, and Johns Hopkins have found that people with deep religious faith show greater physical and emotional health. Of course, one could argue that healthier people are more likely better equipped to make and keep connections to others and subsequently are more likely to thrive in groups of people.<br><br>The second piece of the puzzle became clear to me while I was doing a fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry at Tripler Army Medical Center in Honolulu, Hawaii. During this time I worked extensively with children, teenagers, and families. I consulted with schools, worked with medically ill kids, treated teens whose problems were so severe that they could not live at home, and ran therapy groups for kids and parents. I learned how important early development was to brain function. I saw how positive environments can enhance intellect and emotions, and more often, how negative environments can impair brain function and contribute to both psychiatric and learning disabilities. Any child psychiatrist knows that genetic vulnerability predisposes a person to problems, but the environment plays a large role in the expression of those problems.<br><br>The third major piece of the puzzle dropped into place in 1990. After military service, I set up a private psychiatric clinic in Fairfield, California, forty miles northeast of San Francisco. I saw patients in both outpatient and hospital settings, and directed a hospital unit that treated drug and alcohol abusers who also were diagnosed with psychiatric conditions. During one of the hospital's physician lectures I learned about brain SPECT imaging, a nuclear medicine study that uses very small amounts of a radioactive compound to view the inner workings of the living brain. Unlike standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized axial tomography (CAT) scanners, which show brain anatomy, SPECT -- which stands for single photon emission computed tomography -- evaluates brain physiology. I learned that SPECT was used to look at strokes, head trauma, and dementia. It was also being used by researchers to study depression, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. We could actually see brain patterns associated with "psychiatric" illness, meaning that many mental illnesses were actually visible brain illnesses. This idea would have made Sigmund Freud salivate -- to see the inner workings of the brain as it related to behavior. As I learned more about SPECT and similar technologies, I believed they would change the face of psychiatry in my lifetime, although at the time I had no idea I would become a controversial part of it.<br><br><b>Controversy: To Look or Not to Look</b><br><br>Brain SPECT imaging gives us a visual picture of brain function, a window into the hardware of the soul, as we will see throughout this book. Seeing the initial SPECT studies of my own patients dramatically changed my perception of mental illness and the soul. I had only to look at the brains of people who did bad things to begin to understand that they had poorer access to their own brains, the organ that made them human.

These were smells that once had the power to enthrall him. Now they barely touched him.<br><br>&#x201c;You should step outside,&#x201d; said Madeleine from where she stood at the sink, washing out her cereal bowl. &#x201c;Step out into the sun. It&#x2019;s quite glorious.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I can see that,&#x201d; he said, not moving.<br><br>&#x201c;Sit and have your coffee in one of the Adirondack chairs,&#x201d; she said, setting the bowl down in the drying rack on the countertop. &#x201c;You could use some sun.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d; He nodded meaninglessly and took another sip from the mug he was holding. &#x201c;Is this the same coffee we&#x2019;ve been using?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I �didn&#x2019;t say anything was wrong with it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s the same coffee.&#x201d;<br><br>He sighed. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m getting a cold. Last couple of days, things �haven&#x2019;t had much taste.&#x201d;<br><br>She rested her hands on the edge of the sink island and looked at him. &#x201c;You need to get out more. You need to do something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I mean it. You can&#x2019;t just sit in the house and stare at the wall all day. It will make you sick. It is making you sick. Of course nothing tastes like anything. Have you called Connie Clarke back?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When I feel like it.&#x201d;<br><br>He �didn&#x2019;t think it was a feeling he was likely to have in the foreseeable future. �That&#x2019;s just the way he was these �days&#x2014;�the way he&#x2019;d been for the past six months. It was as though, after the injuries he&#x2019;d suffered at the end of the bizarre Jillian Perry murder case, he had withdrawn from everything connected with normal �life&#x2014;�daily tasks, planning, people, phone calls, commitments of any kind. He&#x2019;d gotten to the point where he liked nothing better than a blank calendar page for the coming �month&#x2014;�no appointments, no promises. He&#x2019;d come to equate withdrawal with freedom.<br><br>At the same time, he had the objectivity to know that what was happening to him �wasn&#x2019;t good, that there was no peace in his freedom. His predominant feeling was hostility, not serenity.<br><br>To some extent he understood the strange entropy that was unwinding the fabric of his life and isolating him. Or at least he could list what he believed to be its causes. Near the top of the list he&#x2019;d place the tinnitus he&#x2019;d been experiencing since he emerged from his coma. In all likelihood it had actually begun two weeks before that, when three shots were fired at him in a small room at nearly �point-�blank range.<br><br>The persistent sound in his ears (which the ear, nose, and throat specialist had explained �wasn&#x2019;t a &#x201c;sound&#x201d; at all but rather a neural anomaly that the brain misinterpreted as sound) was hard to describe. The pitch was high, the volume low, the timbre like a softly hissed musical note. The phenomenon was fairly common among rock musicians and combat veterans, was anatomically mysterious, and, apart from occasional cases of spontaneous remission, was generally incurable. &#x201c;Frankly, Detective Gurney,&#x201d; the doctor had concluded, &#x201c;considering what you&#x2019;ve been through, considering the trauma and the coma, ending up with a mild ringing in your ears is a damn lucky outcome.&#x201d;<br><br>It �wasn&#x2019;t a conclusion Dave could argue with. But it �hadn&#x2019;t made it any easier for him to adjust to the faint whine that enveloped him when all else was silent. It was a particular problem at night. What in daylight might resemble the harmless whistling of a teakettle in a distant room became in the darkness a sinister presence, a cold, metallic atmosphere that encased him.<br><br>Then there were the �dreams&#x2014;�claustrophobic dreams that recalled his hospital experiences, memories of the constricting cast that had held his arm immobile, the difficulty he&#x2019;d had in �breathing&#x2014;�dreams that left him feeling panicky for long minutes after awakening.<br><br>He still had a numb spot on his right forearm close to where the first of his assailant&#x2019;s bullets had shattered the wrist bone. He checked the spot regularly, sometimes hourly, in hopes that its numbness was �receding&#x2014;�or, on bleaker days, in fear that it was spreading. There were occasional, unpredictable, stabbing pains in his side where the second bullet had passed through him. There was also an intermittent �tingling&#x2014;�like an itch impervious to �scratching&#x2014;�at the center of his hairline where the third bullet had fractured his skull.<br><br>Perhaps the most distressing effect of being wounded was the constant need he now felt to be armed. He&#x2019;d carried a gun on the job because regulations had required it. Unlike most cops, he had no fondness for firearms. And when he left the department after �twenty-�five years, he left behind, along with his gold detective&#x2019;s shield, the need to carry a weapon.<br><br>Until he was shot.<br><br>And now, each morning as he got dressed, the inevitable final item he put on was a small ankle holster holding a .32 Beretta. He hated the emotional need for it. Hated the change in him that required the damn thing to always be with him. He&#x2019;d hoped the need would gradually diminish, but so far that �wasn&#x2019;t happening.<br><br>On top of everything else, it seemed to him that Madeleine had been watching him in recent weeks with a new kind of worry in her �eyes&#x2014;�not the fleeting looks of pain and panic he&#x2019;d seen in the hospital, or the alternating expressions of hopefulness and anxiety that had accompanied his early recovery, but something quieter and �deeper&#x2014;�a �half-�hidden chronic dread, as if she were witnessing something terrible.<br><br>Still standing by the breakfast table, he finished his coffee in two large swallows. Then he carried the mug to the sink and let the hot water run into it. He could hear Madeleine down the hall in the mudroom, cleaning out the cat&#x2019;s litter box. The cat had recently been added to the household at Madeleine&#x2019;s initiative. Gurney wondered why. Was it to cheer him up? Engage him in the life of a creature other than himself? If so, it �wasn&#x2019;t working. He had no more interest in the cat than in anything else.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to take a shower,&#x201d; he announced.<br><br>He heard Madeleine say something in the mudroom that sounded like &#x201c;Good.&#x201d; He �wasn&#x2019;t sure �that&#x2019;s what she said, but he �didn&#x2019;t see any point in asking. He went into the bathroom and turned on the hot water.<br><br>A long, steamy �shower&#x2014;�the energetic spray pelting his back minute after minute from the base of his neck down to the base of his spine, relaxing muscles, opening capillaries, clearing mind and �sinuses&#x2014;�produced in him a feeling of �well-�being that was both wonderful and fleeting.<br><br>By the time he&#x2019;d dressed again and returned to the French doors, a jangled sense of unease was already beginning to reassert itself. Madeleine was outside now on the bluestone patio. Beyond the patio was the small section of the pasture that had, through two years of frequent mowings, come to resemble a lawn. Clad in a rough barn jacket, orange sweatpants, and green rubber boots, she was working her way along the edge of the flagstones, stamping enthusiastically down on a spade every six inches, creating a clear demarcation, digging out the encroaching roots of the wild grasses. She gave him a look that seemed at first to convey an invitation for him to join in the project, then disappointment at his obvious reluctance to do so.<br><br>Irritated, he purposely looked away, his gaze drifting down the hillside to his green tractor parked by the barn.<br><br>She followed his line of sight. &#x201c;I was wondering, could you use the tractor to smooth out the ruts?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ruts?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where we park the cars.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure . . .&#x201d; he said hesitantly. &#x201c;I guess.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It �doesn&#x2019;t have to be done right this minute.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d; All traces of equanimity from his shower were now gone, as his train of thought shifted to the peculiar tractor problem he&#x2019;d discovered a month ago and had largely put out of his �mind&#x2014;�except for those paranoid moments when it drove him crazy.<br><br>Madeleine appeared to be studying him. She smiled, put down her spade, and walked around to the side door, evidently so she could take off her boots in the mudroom before coming into the kitchen.<br><br>He took a deep breath and stared at the tractor, wondering for the twentieth time about the mysteriously jammed brake. As if acting in malignant harmony, a dark cloud slowly obliterated the sun. Spring, it seemed, had come and gone.<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>A Huge Favor for Connie Clarke<br><br>The Gurney property was situated on the saddle of a ridge at the end of a rural road outside the Catskill village of Walnut Crossing. The old farmhouse was set on the gentle southern slope of the saddle. An overgrown pasture separated it from a large red barn and a deep pond ringed by cattails and willows, backed by a beech, maple, and �black-�cherry forest. To the north a second pasture rose along the ridgeline �toward a pine forest and a string of small abandoned bluestone quarries that looked out over the next valley.<br><br>The weather had gone through the kind of dramatic �about-�face that was far more common in the Catskill Mountains than in New York City, where Dave and Madeleine had come from. The sky had become a featureless slaty blanket drawn over the hills. The temperature seemed to have dropped at least ten degrees in ten minutes.<br><br>A superfine sleet was beginning to fall. Gurney closed the French doors. As he pulled them tight to secure the latches, he felt a piercing pain in the right side of his stomach. A moment later another followed. This was something he was used to, nothing that three ibuprofens �couldn&#x2019;t suppress. He headed for the bathroom medicine cabinet, thinking that the worst part of it �wasn&#x2019;t the physical discomfort, the worst part was the feeling of vulnerability, the realization that the only reason he was alive was that he&#x2019;d been lucky.<br><br>Luck was not a concept he liked. It seemed to him to be the �fool&#x2019;s substitute for competence. Random chance had saved his life, but random chance was not a trustworthy ally. He knew younger men who believed in good luck, relied on good luck, thought it was something they owned. But at the age of �forty-�eight, Gurney knew damn well that luck is only luck, and the invisible hand that flips the coin is as cold as a corpse.<br><br>The pain in his side also reminded him that he&#x2019;d been meaning to cancel his upcoming appointment with his neurologist in Binghamton. He&#x2019;d had four appointments with the man in less than four months, and they seemed increasingly pointless, unless the only point was to send Gurney&#x2019;s insurance company another bill.<br><br>He kept that phone number with his other medical numbers in his den desk. Instead of continuing into the bathroom for the ibuprofen, he went into the den to make the call. As he was entering the number, he was picturing the doctor: a preoccupied man in his late thirties, with wavy black hair already receding, small eyes, girlish mouth, weak chin, silky hands, manicured fingernails, expensive loafers, dismissive manner, and no visible interest in anything that Gurney thought or felt. The three women who inhabited his sleek, contemporary reception area seemed perpetually confused and irritated by the doctor, by his patients, and by the data on their computer screens.<br><br>The phone was answered on the fourth ring with an impatience verging on contempt. &#x201c;Dr. Huffbarger&#x2019;s office.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is David Gurney, I have an upcoming appointment that �I&#x2019;d&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>The sharp voice cut him off. &#x201c;Hold on, please.&#x201d;<br><br>In the background he could hear a raised male voice that he thought for a moment belonged to an angry patient reeling off a long, urgent �complaint&#x2014;�until a second voice asked a question and a third voice joined the fray in a similar tone of loud, �fast-�talking �indignation&#x2014;�and Gurney realized that what he was hearing was the cable news channel that made sitting in Huffbarger&#x2019;s waiting room insufferable.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; said Gurney with a definite edge. &#x201c;Anybody there? Hello?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just a minute, please.&#x201d;<br><br>The voices that he found so abrasively �empty-�headed continued in the background. He was about to hang up when the receptionist&#x2019;s voice returned.<br><br>&#x201c;Dr. Huffbarger&#x2019;s office, can I help you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. This is David Gurney. I have an appointment I want to cancel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The date?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A week from today at �eleven-�forty a.m.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Spell your name, please.&#x201d;<br><br>He was about to question how many people had appointments on that same day at 11:40, but he spelled his name instead.<br><br>&#x201c;And when do you wish to reschedule it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m just canceling it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll need to reschedule it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can reschedule Dr. Huffbarger&#x2019;s appointments, not cancel them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But the fact �is&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>She interrupted, sounding exasperated. &#x201c;An existing appointment can&#x2019;t be removed from the system without inserting a revised date. �That&#x2019;s the doctor&#x2019;s policy.&#x201d;<br><br>Gurney could feel his lips tightening with anger, way too much anger. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t �really care much about his system or his policy,&#x201d; he said slowly, stiffly. &#x201c;Consider my appointment canceled.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There will be a �missed-�appointment charge.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No there won&#x2019;t. And if Huffbarger has a problem with that, tell him to call me.&#x201d; He hung up, tense, feeling a twinge of chagrin at his childish twisting of the neurologist&#x2019;s name.<br><br>He stared out the den window at the high pasture without �really seeing it.<br><br>What the �hell&#x2019;s the matter with me?<br><br>A jab of pain in his right side offered a partial answer. It also reminded him that he&#x2019;d been on his way to the medicine cabinet when he&#x2019;d made his �appointment-�canceling detour.<br><br>He returned to the bathroom. He �didn&#x2019;t like the look of the man who looked back at him from the mirror on the cabinet door. His forehead was lined with worry, his skin colorless, his eyes dull and tired.<br><br>Christ.<br><br>He knew he had to get back to his daily exercise �regimen&#x2014;�the sets of �push-�ups, �chin-�ups, �sit-�ups that had once kept him in better shape than most men half his age. But now the man in the mirror was looking every bit of �forty-�eight, and he �wasn&#x2019;t happy about it. He �wasn&#x2019;t happy about the daily messages of mortality his body was sending him. He �wasn&#x2019;t happy about his descent from mere introversion into isolation. He �wasn&#x2019;t happy about . . . anything.</p><h2>Cavaliers and Pioneers of Virginia, 1623-1666.</h2><p>By: Nell Marion Nugent, Pub. 1934. Reprinted 2018, 799 pages, Index, ISBN #0-89308-945-1.

Gilbert Jordan describes a way of life familiar to much of rural Texas at that time, but he also gives a heartwarming and fascinating look at the special ways and separate culture of Mason County&#39;s German Methodists. Holidays, foods, chores, songs, poems, proverbs, prayers, riddles, and the linguistic idiosyncrasies of the pietistic Germans who left Fredericksburg in the 1850s are intertwined through this charming narrative.</p><p>The late <b>GILBERT J.

She lives in the Pacific Northwest with her family. Please visit her on the web at <em>www.juliaquinn.com</em>.</p>After reading this superb post-Regency-era romance, the fifth in Quinn's Bridgerton siblings series, it's easy to see why the author's previous book, Romancing Mr. Bridgerton, landed on RWA's Top 10 Favorite Books of 2002 list. Quinn is a consummate storyteller. Her prose is spry and assured, and she excels at creating indelible characters like chatty Eloise Bridgerton and Sir Phillip Crane, the protagonists of this unconventional effort. The novel opens as Eloise, a 28-year-old "spinster," flees London to visit her secret pen pal, Phillip, a troubled botanist and widower. The two plan to see if they are compatible, but Eloise's hopes plummet when she discovers that Phillip is not the romantic charmer of her dreams, but a grumpy father of twins. She agrees to remain for a fortnight, however, and as she interacts with him and his unruly children, she learns that he has a good heart, even if he is an emotionally distant father. Weighty issues such as abuse and discipline threaten to overshadow their relationship at times, but Eloise's sunny disposition brightens the novel, as does the arrival of her four brothers. Quinn's characters possess endearing quirks and flaws, and their easy banter is loaded with wit and warmth. Indeed, readers will likely find themselves rereading certain passages-if not the entire book-in order to prolong their connection to this charismatic clan. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Curse Words Volume 1: The Devil&#39;s Devil (Curse Words, 1)</h2><p>A wizard has appeared in present-day New York!

This Western awareness practice encourages the individual to experience the evolving relationship with oneself, another, the collective, and the divine through the natural impulses of conscious movement, compassionate witnessing, and clear articulation of experience. Through the vivid examples taken from her own practice, Adler demonstrates that physical movement can invite direct experience of spiritual truths. The reader is led through the multiple layers within the discipline--moving and witnessing in dyads and then groups, in the presence of a witnessing teacher--to develop a comprehensive and experiential understanding of this innovative way of work. Designed for professionals and laypersons interested in psychology, bodywork, mystic traditions, or personal transformation, the discipline of Authentic Movement is at the cutting edge of emerging Western healing practices.</p><p>Janet Adler, with a Ph.D. in Mystical Studies, teaches the discipline of Authentic Movement in the United States and Europe and was the founder and director of The Mary Starks Whitehouse Institute, the first school devoted to the study and practice of the discipline.

She lives in northern California where she also works as a hospice chaplain.&#x201c;Janet Adler&#x2019;s shaping of Authentic Movement is a significant response to a widely felt need for a spiritual practice that is both embodied and non-authoritarian. <em>Offering from the Conscious Body</em> gives a lucid description of each element of the discipline of Authentic Movement and its impact on the soul.

Page after page of highly original insights."--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>In this richly detailed portrait of the individual countries and peoples of the Caribbean, Mark Kurlansky brings to life a society and culture often kept hidden from foreigners-the arts, history, politics, and economics of the region, as well as the vivid day-to-day lives of its citizens. From the Newyoriccans of Levittown, Puerto Rico; to the state-salaried popular musicians of Cuba; to the practitioners of good political hurricanemanship (who know how to stretch statistics to bring in relief funds), <i>A Continent of Islands</i> paints portraits that will prove equally fascinating to tourists who know the Caribbean only as a string of beach resorts, and to readers curious about U.S. efforts to influence its neighbors.</p><p><b>Mark Kurlansky</b> has reported on the Caribbean for the <i>Chicago Tribune, The New York Times Magazine, </i>and many other publications.A penetrating analysis of the social, political, sexual, and cultural worlds that exist behind the four-color Caribbean travel posters. Kurlansky, who reports on the Caribbean for The Chicago Tribune, The New York Times, etc., has wide-ranging interests. Here, he discusses such diverse (and unexpected) aspects of his subject as the politics of hurricanes--how island leaders and their rivals take advantage of natural disasters to further their aims; the effects of AIDS on sexual practices throughout the region--the sections on Castro's handling of the AIDS emergency are particularly engrossing; and the impact of American Fundamentalist proselytizing on traditional West Indian religious groups. The author leavens his material by alternating these in-depth discussions with amusing vignettes of some of his own experiences below the Tropic of Cancer. His description of the arrival of the first McDonald's outlet on Barbados, for example, is hilarious: The Bajans, originally excited at the prospect of Big Macs, considered the burgers disappointing ``little bitty thing[s]'' when they finally appeared. One of Kurlansky's major themes is the danger inherent in a tourism-based island economy--which he believes could lead to the corruption of West Indian culture. He speaks eloquently about the cultural roots of the Caribbean peoples--though he seems not fully aware of the discrepancies that lurk there--pointing out, for example, that ``There are those Caribbeans, usually lighter- skinned, who argue that Caribbeans...use their history as an excuse...to avoid accepting responsibility....Even this is part of the conditioning of their history....To fight this mentality is to fight the legacies of history.'' Should be read by every West Indies traveler and even by old Caribbean hands, who will find here page after page of highly original insights.

For many parents, who are always busy, usually tired, and probably not trained in dealing with children, the words &#x201c;tranquility&#x201d; and &#x201c;parenting&#x201d; do not go together. Don&#x2019;t you just wish there was some technique out there that could help you become calm, content, and confident parent? Something that you could have on hand all the time to help you through your most challenging situations and stressful days? <br>Well, there is something, and it comes from a wisdom tradition that has been helping people through difficult situations for about 2300 years. The psychological techniques developed by ancient Stoics have recently been rediscovered, and Stoicism is enjoying a renaissance among people from all walks of life who are looking for fulfillment, tranquility, and yes, the meaning of life. Modern Stoicism has straightforward answers to all these questions, as well as practical techniques for achieving eudaimonia (the Greek word for &#x201c;human flourishing&#x201d;). Stoicism encourages everyone to think things through for themselves and use their own capacity for reason and goodness. And once you learn the basic principles of Stoicism, you can apply them all the time, in any situation. <br>Tranquility Parenting describes how Brittany Polat discovered modern Stoicism and what it can offer to stressed-out parents of the 21st century. As a mother of three young children, Polat used to constantly doubt her parenting abilities. She felt anxious, frustrated, and guilty about her perceived failings as a parent. Now, as a practicing Stoic, she gained the confidence and calm she was craving and has more energy to be fully engaged and happy with them. <br>What will this book do for you? It will not tell you how to potty train your child, but it will tell you how to enjoy the time you spend potty training your child. It will not tell you how to monitor your teen on social media, but it will show you how to use practical wisdom to make decisions about media consumption. It will not tell you how to make your kids eat vegetables, but it will explain how to be present and engaged while you are teaching your kids to eat vegetables. So if you are willing to invest time and energy in applying Stoic insights, you may find that tranquility parenting is not only possible, but truly the best option for you and your family.</p><p>Brittany Polat is a practicing Stoic, mother to three young children, and blogger who writes about Stoic family life. She is especially interested in exploring ways that Stoic principles can lead to a rich and rewarding life for parents and children. See more of her writing on her blog at apparentstoic.comPolat, a practitioner of stoicism and creator of apparentstoic.com, draws on the philosophical school&#x2019;s practical and relevant wisdom in a straightforward and lucidly presented primer on stoic parenting. She is careful to differentiate stoicism&#x2019;s contemporary connotations&#x2014;as referring to &#x201c;someone who doesn&#x2019;t show or even feel any emotion&#x201d;&#x2014;from the classical teachings of Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius, who prized &#x201c;emotional tranquility in tough situations&#x201d; and a logical approach to positive and negative emotions alike as a path to &#x201c;lasting peace and happiness&#x201d; not tied to material goods or fleeting emotions. Noting the Stoics were &#x201c;master psychologists,&#x201d; Polat finds their ideas applicable to &#x201c;difficult situations&#x201d; commonly encountered with children, including resistance to potty training, intra-sibling jealousy, and back talk to parents. In eight short chapters, Polat walks readers through giving up the need for control, rethinking value judgments, teaching children values, and in general becoming, in Seneca&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;cheerful, calm, and undisturbed.&#x201d; While Polat&#x2019;s work may not replace mindfulness with tranquility as the new self-care buzzword, it makes a good case for the applicability of an ancient intellectual tradition to modern child care.

This book offers strategies to build strong mental habits that will help you focus on what is in your control as a parent and give you the confidence and courage to make good judgments day in and day out. (Douglas Haddad, Award-Winning Educator and author of The Ultimate Guide to Raising Teens and Tweens)<br><br>This unique contribution to parenting literature is a well-crafted compilation of the wisdom blogger Polat has gained as a parent and practicing Stoic. Readers who enjoy history and philosophy may appreciate the primer on Stoicism (both historical and contemporary) and enjoy applying tips such as Marcus Aurelius&#x2019; morning mantra to their own parenting lives. A main tenet of Stoicism is that one must be a good person to live a flourishing life, making it an easily relatable belief system. The stories and scenarios Polat includes from her own parenting experience are highly relevant. She tackles topics ranging from her reaction to a broken plate now versus how would have reacted before her philosophical shift, to scenarios for helping kids gain a perspective on judgment, criticism, and self-control. Finally, the chapter summaries and &#x201c;Make It Your Own&#x201d; takeaways encourage preemptive action (aka homework) that will at a minimum increase parents' level of tranquility and hopefully even solve some parenting angst in the process.

It is a genuine joy to recommend this outstanding work.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;David S. Dockery, president, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Discipleship and eschatology are not often thought of in tandem.&nbsp;Discipleship is about following Jesus here and now, while eschatology is about what happens then and there. But in this important book, Trevin Wax shows the coinherence of these two biblical themes.&nbsp;An impressive theological study written with an eye for Great Commission reflection and praxis.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;Timothy George, founding dean, Beeson Divinity School of Samford University &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It is not a matter of whether eschatology will shape the church&#x2019;s life but only a matter of which one. Discipleship, a burning need in the syncretistic American church, surely needs to be re-envisioned in terms of equipping God&#x2019;s people to more and more live out of a biblical eschatology of the kingdom. In this book&nbsp;Trevin&nbsp;Wax&nbsp;takes up this challenge and encounters the two most powerful rival eschatologies of our day&#x2014;the Enlightenment notion of progress and Consumerism. I pray that God will use this book to enable the American church to reimagine discipleship in its missionary setting.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;Michael W. Goheen, director of theological education, Missional Training Center, and adjunct professor of missional theology, Covenant Theological Seminary<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The philosopher Martin Heidegger famously defined human existence as &#x2018;being-toward-death,&#x2019; a posture that generates anxiety in view of our limited time. Trevin Wax does him one better: the Christian life is a matter of being-towards-discipleship, and discipleship is a matter of being-towards-<i>end</i>-time. Disciples take their bearings from the story of Jesus, especially its end: the hope of resurrection. Wax convincingly sets out the biblical basis for &#x2018;eschatological discipleship&#x2019;, which means the importance of waking up (and staying awake) to the reality that our citizenship in heaven begins now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;Kevin J.

Determined to live life to the fullest, the friends refused to give into despair or let physical limitations control what was possible for Justin.<br><br>So when Justin heard about the Camino de Santiago, a 500-mile trek through Spain, he wondered aloud to Patrick whether the two of them could ever do it.

Personal Note from the Author: Growing up, I adopted the profound misconception that clothing mattered. It mattered if others could see you, it mattered if you wanted others to be seen with you, and it mattered if the weather warranted it. That was then, this is now. My present-day naturist existence is not a learned state of being however. More so, it is a reawakening of my inner child. It&#x2019;s a bare bones acceptance of my body despite its gloriously flawed and natural state. No doubt, it may also be middle-aged madness gone amok. Enough said.

But he knew instinctively that if he opened his mouth to try and suck in a breath, he would die.<br><br>Gritting his teeth fiercely, Murphy opened his eyes instead. And a pair of yellow, animal eyes stared back. Then a wildly gaping jaw came into focus through the greenish gloom, pointed teeth bared in a silent snarl. Murphy reached out, expecting the teeth to clamp down on his hand, but the dog face had disappeared, sucked back into the watery darkness.<br><br>It was no good. He had to get some air into his lungs before they burst. He turned his face upward, toward the feeble light, and after an agonizing few seconds during which he had the horrifying sense that he was sinking, not rising, his head broke the surface.<br><br>He sucked in a huge, spluttering breath, simultaneously grabbing on to the narrow stone ledge that projected from the side of the pit. Resting his head against the jagged rock, he could feel something warm mingling with the freezing water. Blood. As the pain suddenly hit him, a wild carousel of thoughts started racing round his brain.<br><br>Laura. He would never see her again. She wouldn&#x2019;t even know he had died here, in this remote, godforsaken place. She would never know his last thoughts had been about her.<br><br>Then he remembered. Laura was dead. She&#x2019;d died in his arms. <br><br>And now he was about to join her. With that thought, his body seemed to relax, accepting its fate, and he felt himself slipping back into the surging torrent.<br><br>No! He couldn&#x2019;t give up. He couldn&#x2019;t let the crazy old man win at last. He had to find a way out.<br>But first he had to find those puppies. <br><br>Clutching the ledge with both hands, Murphy took a series of quick, deep breaths, hyperventilating to force as much oxygen as possible into his lungs. He&#x2019;d done enough cave diving to know he could stay under a full two minutes if he had to. But that was under ideal conditions. Right now he had to contend with the effects of shock, blood loss, and bone-shaking cold&#x2013;all the while trying to find two little dogs somewhere in a swirling maelstrom. As he let himself slip back under the freezing water, he wondered&#x2013;not for the first time&#x2013;how he managed to get himself into these messes.<br><br>The answer was simple. One word: Methuselah. <br><br>Murphy had been making his way carefully through the cave, fanning his flashlight across the dank black walls, when he found himself standing not on loose shale but what felt like solid wooden planks. Ever alert to tricks and traps, Murphy instinctively reacted as if he&#x2019;d just stepped onto a tray of burning coals&#x2013;but before he could leap aside, the trapdoor sprang open. As he felt himself plunging into the void, a familiar cackling laugh shattered the silence, echoing crazily off the rock walls. <br><br>&#x201c;Welcome to the game, Murphy! Get out of this one if you can!&#x201d;<br><br>As Murphy cartwheeled through space, his brain was still trying to come up with a suitable response. But all that came out was a grunt as he slammed into the ground like a bag of cement and the air was punched out of his lungs, before the impact flung him sideways and his head connected with a boulder. For a moment all was black, buzzing darkness. Then he raised himself up on his hands and knees and his senses returned one by one: He could feel the damp grit between his fingers; he could taste it in his mouth; he could smell stagnant water; he could dimly make out the shadowy walls of the pit he&#x2019;d fallen into.<br><br>And he could hear the fretful whining of what sounded like two cold, wet&#x2013;and very scared&#x2013;little dogs.<br>He turned toward the sound and there they were, shivering together on a narrow ledge. A pair of German shepherd puppies. Murphy shook his head: He always tried to prepare himself for anything where Methuselah was concerned, but what were a couple of puppies doing in the middle of an underground cave complex miles from anywhere? Could they have gotten lost and somehow wandered this far from the surface? He didn&#x2019;t think so. Much more likely they were there because Methuselah had put them there. <br><br>They were part of the game.<br><br>Fighting his natural instinct to gather the bedraggled pups tightly in his arms and tell them everything was going to be okay, he approached the ledge cautiously. They looked so helpless. But that didn&#x2019;t mean harmless. Nothing in Methuselah&#x2019;s games was harmless, and if he had put them there for Murphy to find, then something about the dogs was out of whack. He just had to figure out what.<br><br>Just then the steady dripping sound that had been nagging away at the back of Murphy&#x2019;s consciousness since he landed in the pit started to get louder. He turned in the direction of the noise and suddenly it became a roaring, as a huge wave of water surged through a narrow gap in the rocks. In a second a frothing tide was tugging at his ankles, pulling him off balance. Forgetting Methuselah&#x2019;s mind games, he pushed himself back toward the ledge, scooped up the puppies, and stuffed them under his jacket. His eyes darted round the walls of the pit, looking for anything that would help him find a way out, as the rising water swirled around his chest. The puppies were just a diversion, he thought bitterly, fighting to keep his footing. He hadn&#x2019;t spotted the real danger until it was too late. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, fellas, I&#x2019;ll get you out of here,&#x201d; he assured them with more confidence than he felt. Then the torrent lifted him off his feet and the panicking dogs squirmed out of his jacket. Fighting to keep his head above the surface, he grabbed for them, but his fingers closed on icy water and then he too was engulfed, spinning out of control like a bunch of wet clothes in a Laundromat washer.<br><br>He closed his eyes, and even as his lungs started hungrily demanding air, he tried to find a calm place in his mind where he could think. He checked through his options. The water would soon reach the level of the trapdoor, which was no doubt secured against escape. So, search for another way out under the water, or look for the puppies again before they drowned? If he tried to find a way out on his own, the puppies would be dead by the time he found it. If he tried to save the puppies first, he&#x2019;d probably wind up too exhausted to find a way out. If there was a way out.<br><br>So much for his options.<br><br>The only shred of hope he could cling to was the fact that this was a game. And a game, however deadly, still had rules. <br><br>But there was no way he could figure them out while his lungs were screaming and his thought processes were beginning to go fuzzy due to lack of oxygen.<br><br>Get some air. Then go after those puppies. If he was still alive after that, maybe God would give him some inspiration.<br><br>When Murphy walked into the lab, he was greeted by the sight of a young woman bent over a workbench, her jet-black hair, tied back in a ponytail, making a stark contrast with her crisp white lab coat as she scrutinized a sheet of parchment. She didn&#x2019;t look up as the door clicked shut behind him, and he stood for a moment, smiling at the expression of fierce concentration on her face.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you grinning at, Professor?&#x201d; she asked, her eyes never leaving the parchment.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing, Shari. Nothing at all. It&#x2019;s just nice to see someone so absorbed in their work, is all.&#x201d;<br><br>She gave a short &#x201c;hmph,&#x201d; still not looking up, and Murphy&#x2019;s smile broadened. Shari Nelson was one of the top students in his biblical archaeology class at Preston University, and for almost two years she had been his part-time research assistant. In that time he&#x2019;d come to appreciate her passion for the subject, her limitless capacity for hard work, and her sharp intelligence. But most of all, he valued her warm and generous spirit. She might be pretending to ignore him right now, but they&#x2019;d been through enough tragedy and heartache together in the past year, with the deaths of his wife and her brother still painful every hour of every day, for him to know that she would drop everything&#x2013;even a fascinating ancient parchment like the one she was studying&#x2013;if he needed her.<br><br>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s up, Shari? Did the results from the carbon-dating tests on our little pottery fragment come in?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; Shari replied, returning the parchment to the clear plastic container on the bench. &#x201c;But something has definitely arrived for you.&#x201d; She gestured toward a large white envelope with the purple and orange lettering of Federal Express.<br><br>Shari watched eagerly as Murphy picked up the package. Clearly she&#x2019;d had a hard time containing her curiosity while she waited for Murphy to arrive at the lab. <br><br>&#x201c;Strange,&#x201d; he mused. &#x201c;No return address. Just Babylon. Doesn&#x2019;t look like it went through the usual FedEx mailing process.&#x201d; He heard Shari gasp. Babylon, she knew all too well, could only mean one thing: a whole heap of trouble. <br><br>Murphy carefully opened the envelope and shook the contents&#x2013;a smaller envelope with the words Professor Murphy printed in heavy marker and a xeroxed page from a map&#x2013;out onto the workbench. He glanced at the map, then opened the second envelope. Inside was an index card with three words typed on it.<br><br>Chemar. Zepheth. Kopher.<br><br>He handed it to Shari while he examined the map. A route had been marked in pink felt-tip from Raleigh, moving west, across the border into Tennessee. Where the snaking line stopped, there were an X and four barely legible words written in a spidery scrawl:<br><br>&#x201c;Cave of the Waters. Mean anything to you, Shari?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It sounds like somewhere you definitely don&#x2019;t want to go,&#x201d; she replied firmly.<br>He winced. Exactly what Laura would have said. Same tone of voice, even.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming back to me. I&#x2019;ve heard of this place. It&#x2019;s in the Great Smoky Mountains . . . past Asheville, somewhere between Waynesville and Bryson City.&#x201d; If he remembered it right, the cave was discovered in the early 1900s but had never been fully explored, because the high water table in the area&#x2013;not to mention at least three underground streams that ran through it&#x2013;caused the chambers to flood periodically. It was supposed to contain a vast labyrinth of passageways, but no one knew how far they extended. Caving expeditions had been officially discouraged after three cavers were lost without a trace in the early seventies.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, so we&#x2019;ve got directions to a cave. Now, what about the message on the card? What do you make of it, Shari?&#x201d;<br><br>She repeated the words. &#x201c;Chemar. Zepheth. Kopher. It&#x2019;s Hebrew. No problem there. But beyond that it&#x2019;s got me stumped. Does it have something to do with Babylon?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It wouldn&#x2019;t surprise me,&#x201d; he said, stroking his chin thoughtfully. &#x201c;But right now it doesn&#x2019;t mean any more to me than it does to you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And there&#x2019;s no signature anywhere, and no return address. So how can we find out who sent this?&#x201d;<br>Murphy gave a half-smile. &#x201c;Come on, Shari. A mysterious message in an ancient language? A set of directions to a remote spot? Babylon? He didn&#x2019;t really need to sign it, did he?&#x201d;<br><br>Shari sighed. &#x201c;I guess not. I was just hoping . . . you know, that it might be something else. Something innocent. Not one of these crazy games where you&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>She could tell Murphy wasn&#x2019;t listening anymore. He was studying the map intently, already halfway there.

Suitable for beginning and advanced students, as well as teachers and scholars, this handbook of Greek verbs categorizes every verb in the Greek New Testament, lists all the principal parts that actually occur, provides rules for understanding the variations in the principal parts, and explains any remaining irregularities in simple English. This is all preceded by a detailed introduction that explains the format and use of the book, presents some general rules about the changes in the principal parts of Greek verbs, and reviews more comprehensively than most grammars certain key concepts like the structure of Greek verbs, augment, reduplication, and the formation of compound verbs. The index is a reference work in itself in that it lists alphabetically every verb in the Greek New Testament along with its category, frequency, and principal parts.</p><p>Laurence M.

In this book, Laurence Vance takes the wraps off much of the mystery surrounding the many forms that Greek verbs undergo while donating meaning to a literary text. Any language exhibits amazing fidelity to certain rules. Vance identifies many of these to put an end to agonizing frustration in connection with clarification of verb forms, especially those of the so-called irregular kind. Frequently lexicons seem to close their doors to searchers of a main verb entry. With the help of Vance s book, sentences will begin to make more sense and lexicons will open their doors to the once-hapless searcher. ~ Frederick William Danker, Ph.D., editor of A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (3rd ed., The University of Chicago Press, 2000), and Christ Seminary-Seminex Professor Emeritus of New Testament at the Lutheran School of Theology in Chicago. --Back cover of book</p><h2>Charisma: The Gift of Grace, and How It Has Been Taken Away from Us</h2><p>From the profoundly influential social theorist Philip Rieff comes a posthumously published analysis of the deepest level of crisis in our culture.According to Rieff, the contemporary notion of charisma-the personal magnetism of political leaders or movie stars-is a tragic misunderstanding of a profoundly important concept. Charisma originally meant religious grace and authority transferred through divine inspiration, before it evolved into little more than a form of celebrity stripped of moral considerations. Rieff argues that without morality, the gift of grace becomes indistinguishable from the gift of evil and devolves into a license to destroy in the name of faith or ideology. Offering brilliant interpretations of Kierkegaard, Weber, Kafka, Nietzsche, and Freud, Rieff shows how certain thinkers attacked the very possibility of faith and genuine charisma and helped prepare the way for a therapeutic culture in which it is impossible to recognize anything as sacred.</p><p><b>Philip Rieff</b>, Benjamin Franklin Professor of Sociology and University Professor Emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania, is author of the classic works <i>Freud: The Mind of the Moralist</i>, <i>The Triumph of the Therapeutic</i>, and <i>Fellow Teachers </i>and the editor of <i>The Collected Papers of Sigmund Freud. </i>Rieff died in July 2006.<b>Chapter One: Spray-on Charisma</b><br><br>It all seems perfectly plausible; in fact, the item advertised on p. 2 of this book may be on the market now, having seen it prophesied in the <i>New Yorker</i> cartoon.<br><br>Is it not likely that since all action is now decided from the outside in that a spray-on charisma can will soon be invented? We shall have the recognition factors sorted out, and so by purchase smartly in the economy size, spray ourselves into something extraordinary. This is simply to say what S�ren Kierkegaard said more than a century ago, that all inwardness is lost. In this book, I have tried to work through, critically, toward an understanding of how my inwardness was lost for me, and to recognize those chiefly responsible for the loss&#x2014;our charismatics. The writing has not been therapeutic; on the contrary, that is the point. From the extraordinary way in which Max Weber, among others, canned charisma for us, I have learned that I am opposed to all therapies. The therapeutic is that terrible beast who has been slouching toward Bethlehem. The pity of our lives is that there are no charismatics to save us from him. We can hope for the spray-on charisma can, which will realize the ancient dream of making even the least of us extraordinarily attractive on the outside. The world is fuller than ever before of people who look like charismatics and try to act the part; like the early medieval sect of Waldenses, they insist on wearing sandals, some even in winter. If not to be like the founder, which was the original reason for wearing sandals, then to be recognizable, a little extraordinary, in lieu of the spray-on charisma can. I doubt that the Western world has ever been so full of innovators all hawking their changes, or so full of deviants, all asserting their rights. Where are the charismatics? The question is, more precisely, who are the charismatics? Who deviates decisively from the beaten path? Who opens a new road, a different way of life and revelation for men to go, even remain, for such openers of new roads are all but lost. Is he a guru, like Timothy Leary, for the guru, in its original meaning, meant, I understand, heavy, weighty, venerable. A modern guru, a figure like Timothy Leary or Norman O. Brown, carries the reverse meaning. He is deliberately weightless and preaches weightlessness to us. The modern guru represents the ephemeral, the fugitive, the contingent. It is in this sense that he is an exemplar, someone to follow.<br><br>Where are our gifted leaders, our charismatics? Perhaps the idea itself is an illusion and not only has no future, but has no past. My position in this book will be that there is no charisma without creed&#x2014;there must be a conscious and intense established symbolic* in the field before there can be a standard that can be used to break through that field. Doubt, skepticism, infidelity, are not charisma, nor are they therapy, the two major terms I shall use throughout this book. Yet charisma proclaims something to be true and important. In Weber&#x2019;s idea, it announces a way, it lights the fire of a new interdict, it has the emphasis of infallibility, no less than that which it breaks through. But I ask again, where are our charismatics? Certainly, we have stunning numbers of people who copy the outward features of the charismatic. They insist on wearing sandals. But there is a great new perplexity in an anti-credal order such as our own, because being therapeutics now there is no correlation between soul and body. All is body. Nothing material now emanates from the spiritual. We are mirrors still, but not mirrors of some spiritual or inner reality from which our appearance is derived. Rather, our world is as a theater, and in that theater, rather than the world as church, the program announces the end of all sacramental action; wearing sandals itself must be put in quotation marks&#x2014;it is a role, a put-on, one of the many costumes that may be worn, one of the transformations and adjustments for which the therapeutic more or less consciously can prepare himself.<br><br>It is through Weber that charisma promises to be, and has become, a marketable item. But in the course of this book, I shall look at charisma as it has been considered before Weber and after. And the book itself intends to go beyond Weber&#x2019;s thought and to try to establish what a charismatic may be, if he is to oppose the therapeutic. Therapeutic and charismatic are proposed in this book as ideal anti-types. Thus, for Weber, the charismatic leader proposes a radical breakthrough, a transformation of those transgressive motifs proposed by him in his Protestant pathos as shadowing of a new normative order. The therapeutic, on the other hand, also proposes a radical transformation of transgressive motifs, but not as foreshadowings of a new normative order. Indeed, the key to understanding the therapeutic as the successor ideal anti-type of the charismatic is that he hopes for, as his own lifestyle proclaims, a society in which there is no normative order. It is further my intention to demonstrate how the modern Protestant and Weberian conceptions of the charismatic in fact lead toward this successor type, the therapeutic, and toward a transformation of transgressive motifs in a way that throws no shadow of normative order upon the future. My thesis shall be that the therapeutic is the ideal anti-type and real successor of the charismatic. I understand the charismatic as somehow in truth an innovative resolver of ambivalences by the introduction of new interdicts into our lives. The fire of a new no. The therapeutic is a releaser from the interdicts, a transgressive figure. The two are thus very closely related and it is their relation that is the chief concern of this book, and not an analysis of Weber, Marx, Freud, or any particular figure. They are pegs around which at times, given my lack of greater skills, I have hung my analysis. But they are important pegs, and they themselves have helped make the transition between the dominance of the charismatic ideal and the therapeutic anti-ideal.<br><br>In this period of transition, our would-be charismatics are better understood as terrorists. The relation between the transitional, modern notion of charisma canned in the sense Weber, as I shall show, canned it, and terror needs some preliminary explanation. Perhaps the best place to begin is with the suggestion that holiness is entirely interdictory. A moral absolute thus becomes the object of all. Holy terror is charismatic; our terror is unholy. For our charismatics are engaged in no wrestlings of angels, but, rather, with the obeying of demons. Jacob was a charismatic when Laban and Jacob took mutual pledges before the God of their fathers; Jacob swears by the fear of his father, Isaac (Genesis 31:53). What is this charismatic fear? What is holy terror? Is it a fear of a mere father; in a phantasmagoric enlargement, Freud&#x2019;s idea is silly. Holy terror is rather fear of oneself, fear of the evil in oneself and in the world. It is also fear of punishment. Without this necessary fear, charisma is not possible. To live without this high fear is to be a terror oneself, a monster. And yet to be monstrous has become our ambition, for it is our ambition to live without fear. All holy terror is gone. The interdicts have no power. This is the real death of God and of our own humanity. It is out of sheer terror that charisma develops. We live in terror but never in holy terror. Those are the only alternatives, as I shall try to show in the course of this book.<br><br>A great charismatic does not save us from holy terror, but rather conveys it. One of my intentions is to make us again more responsive to the possibility of holy terror.<br>To lead into an understanding of the difference between the terror in our lives and holy terror, the difference between charisma and therapy, the two alternatives we have before us, the most convenient object is the thought of Max Weber on charisma. That will lead us also, by the way, into the deepest tension of modern sociology as a discipline functioning to dissolve all inwardness. We turn, therefore, first to an analysis of Max Weber&#x2019;s thought on charisma. Weber&#x2019;s sociology of charisma embodies at its greatest the polemical thrust of sociology, its intellectualism, its high function in the process of rationalization, that dissolution into meaninglessness from which such a discipline as sociology cannot save us. This intellectualism is coupled with a deliberate detachment from responsibility that goes under the name of science. Of course, such an intellectualism can be a conservative force, as Weber noted in the case of the priestly rationalizers of written sacred traditions. Or, it can be conservative through its defense of the high social status and institutional responsibility of the professional rationalizers themselves, the sociologists. But, even so, the interdicts are generally reduced by reason to magic, and the attack of sociology, like the attack of its Protestant predecessor, is on the very animus of charisma, as magic. Weber&#x2019;s entire treatment of religion is utterly suspect, and I shall try to unfold the suspicions. Weber is himself the culminating expression, I think, of the Protestant pathos, which turns into evolutionism and progressivism, with its mystique of breaks with the established order as the highest expression of the intellect and of soul. This Protestant pathos, this mystique of breaks with the established order, is less than a revolution and more than a reform. It is that relentless lusting after progressive social change that characterizes the liberal era and leads straight into the Marxist pathos, with its generalized species man, who turns into an apparatchik and party functionary. The truest reason for beginning with Weber is that in particular through his reworking of the idea of charisma, Weber made the most genuinely honest soundings, as Karl Jaspers said in his memorial address of the human spirit in the contemporary world. Weber achieved a form of such genuineness that his work became the adequate expression of truly original thought and fulfilled humanity. These soundings of the human spirit in the contemporary world need not remain unchallenged and opposed, and in this manuscript I have dared not only to learn from them, but to challenge and oppose them.<br>*A symbolic is a particular order of interdicts and remissions.</p><h2>Ben And Me (Turtleback School &amp; Library Binding Edition)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

The author lives in Paris, France.chapter 1<br>Linus Hoppe sat on the third level of the Zip, pinching his nose. The other passengers seemed oblivious to the vanilla fragrance that permeated the train car, but Linus couldn't get used to it. The sickly-sweet odor clung to his clothes and, worse, made him feel ill. He knew that something had to be done to cover up the foul-smelling vapors emanating from the subterranean Industrial Zone, but why had vanilla been chosen? Linus couldn't help wondering if the senior managers of the Trans-Urban Company had ever ventured into the transportation system since they'd decided to install the air fresheners.<br>The train glided noiselessly through the tunnels. Beyond the windows, there was nothing to see for miles, just darkness dotted at regular intervals by the glow of the small light fixtures on the tunnel walls. Back in the early 2000s, the train used to emerge into the open air right after leaving Paris. But today the regulations were much stricter, and any potential blight on the landscape was buried deep underground. The old railroad tracks had become places where people went for leisurely strolls.<br>Linus flipped open his pocket computer. The trip to his suburban station lasted twenty minutes, giving him ample time to go over the day's courses.<br>"Hello, Linus, my little cookie!" the computer blared unexpectedly.<br>Linus quickly lowered the volume as several people turned to look at him. He smiled at them, slightly embarrassed. Once again Chem had played one of his practical jokes. Not a day went by without Linus's hacker friend tampering with his programs. This time the joke was harmless, but the other day Chem had nearly wrecked Linus's touch-sensitive screen.<br>"Honestly, Chem," Linus had said to him, "why don't you target someone else?"<br>Chem had laughed into his scarf. "Anyone else would beat me up!" he'd said. "You're the only one at school who still has a sense of humor!"<br>Linus sighed. Chem was right: ever since the beginning of the year, the mood in school had deteriorated daily. Students glanced at one another suspiciously, they worked furtively in their own little corners, and classrooms were like battlefields. Not that there was any physical violence; after all, no one wanted to get expelled from the system. Instead the attacks were underhanded, with countless wounds to self-esteem, strings of petty intrigues, psychological bruises, and mental aggressions. In this arena, humor was definitely out of place.<br>"They're scared stiff," Chem kept grumbling to Linus. "The end-of-year exam is driving them all crazy." <br>Linus could relate. The end-of-year exam was all he could think about too. In three months, he was going to be tested by the Great Processor. The outcome would determine his future. A score of 150 or higher guaranteed he would remain in Realm One--where his life would barely change. He'd continue living at home, with his parents and his sister, Mieg, who had scored 185 two years before, and he would pursue his studies in the city. Later on, he'd receive fantastic bank loans to buy a house in the Protected Zone, and he'd be promoted to a position of responsibility, as his parents had. A score of less than 150, on the other hand, would have consequences he couldn't begin to imagine. One thing was certain: he would have to leave his home in the Protected Zone. <br>But Linus knew he had nothing to fear. With minimal effort, he was always among the top students. He had never had any problems with his teachers, had never been reprimanded, and had hardly ever been absent. According to his parents, the exam was a mere formality.<br>Still, Linus thought, accidents happen.<br>For several months, the word accident had been popping up in his thoughts regularly. The word didn't refer to a concrete reality; it simply sprang to mind unexpectedly, simultaneously frightening and tempting, much like a plane ticket to an exotic destination.<br>Having been completely absorbed in his thoughts, Linus realized he no longer had time to go over his courses. The train would be stopping in five minutes. He shut down his computer.<br>"See you soon, Cookie!" mumbled the synthetic voice.<br>Linus couldn't help smiling. Chem was an unbelievable prankster, but in spite of his jokes, he was also the best friend Linus had at school. The trouble was that by overplaying the rebel, Chem risked not being admitted into the best realm. Everyone knew that insubordinates were sent to Realm Three, where they endured a special treatment--one that involved a mixture of iron discipline and bullying. The ones who knuckled under were reevaluated, with the luckier ones reinstated in Realm One. As for the others, no one knew what became of them. But the teachers' threats had no effect on Chem's attitude. He persisted in folding his arms and smiling arrogantly. When Linus expressed worry, Chem boasted, "I can do whatever I want with the Great Processor. Don't forget, Cookie, I'm a computer genius! If I choose to, I can bust its circuits!"<br>Looking out the window, Linus caught sight of the halo of light from the approaching station. He shook his head. Of course, Chem was bragging. No one had ever succeeded in outwitting the Great Processor.<br>Linus buttoned up his jacket, put his computer away in his backpack, and headed to the first level of the train. The doors swished open and Linus stepped out onto the platform. No more vanilla scent here. He could breathe through his nose again. Relieved, he swiped his ID card through the slot at the gate.<br>"ID: Linus Hoppe. Authorized access into the Protected Zone. Good evening," said the electronic voice at the gate. Making his way through the crowd, Linus headed toward the elevators.<br>"Hey, Linus!" a familiar voice called to him from behind.<br>It was Mieg, his big sister, coming home from school too. She caught up with him, smiling and happy as usual. Over her long curly black hair, she wore a red hat with the insignia of the HIA, the Higher Institute of Architecture.<br>"Did you have a good day?" she asked, kissing Linus on the cheek.<br>"Not particularly good or bad. There were no fries at the cafeteria, poor Iona got another lousy grade in biotech, that moron Rodrigo made Marny cry, and Chem fiddled with my programs again. Routine, as you can see."<br>Mieg frowned. "You're very blase for a fourteen-year-old!"<br>Linus shrugged. The elevator had arrived. They were pushed along by the crowd cramming into it.<br>"Unlike you," Mieg said, "I was very excited the year of my exam. I worked hard, but it was fascinating. You don't seem to realize how much it's worth the effort."<br>Linus looked down at his feet and all the feet around his. From the shoes alone, he could tell that the people surrounding him lived in the Protected Zone. Theirs was the simple, clean, and comfortable footwear of the elite.<br>"Are you listening to me?" Mieg asked, slightly annoyed.<br>"Sorry, I'm tired."<br>The elevator doors opened. Again, Linus let himself be carried by the flow of humanity, happy to breathe the cold, dry air outside.<br>"You'll take a restorative bath when we get home," Mieg said, adjusting her hat. "Then I'll make you one of my tasty vitamin-enriched shakes. Okay?"<br>Linus nodded. He started walking along the edge of the sidewalk, his nose in the air. Between the bare branches of the trees, he saw that the winter moon was rising. Everything was quiet. The only sounds were the clicks of window shutters being rolled down, the mewing of a cat, laughter, and the notes of a piano coming from an artist's residence.<br>"There's no better place on earth. Don't you agree?" Mieg murmured as she noticed that Linus's mind was elsewhere.<br>They walked the rest of the way in silence, each appreciating the artificial serenity of the Protected Zone.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Science of Good and Evil: Why People Cheat, Gossip, Care, Share, and Follow the Golden Rule (Holt Paperback)</h2><p><p><b>From bestselling author Michael Shermer, an investigation of the evolution of morality that is "a paragon of popularized science and philosophy" The Sun (Baltimore)</b></p><p>A century and a half after Darwin first proposed an "evolutionary ethics," science has begun to tackle the roots of morality. Just as evolutionary biologists study why we are hungry (to motivate us to eat) or why sex is enjoyable (to motivate us to procreate), they are now searching for the very nature of humanity.</p><p>In <i>The Science of Good and Evil</i>, science historian Michael Shermer explores how humans evolved from social primates to moral primates; how and why morality motivates the human animal; and how the foundation of moral principles can be built upon empirical evidence. </p><p>Along the way he explains the implications of scientific findings for fate and free will, the existence of pure good and pure evil, and the development of early moral sentiments among the first humans. As he closes the divide between science and morality, Shermer draws on stories from the Yanamam�, infamously known as the "fierce people" of the tropical rain forest, to the Stanford studies on jailers' behavior in prisons. <i>The Science of Good and Evil</i> is ultimately a profound look at the moral animal, belief, and the scientific pursuit of truth<b>.</b></p></p><p><p><b>Michael Shermer</b> is the author of <i>The Believing Brain</i>, <i>Why People Believe Weird Things</i>, <i>The Science of Good and Evil</i>, <i>The Mind Of The Market</i>, <i>Why Darwin Matters</i>, <i>Science Friction</i>, <i>How We Believe</i> and other books on the evolution of human beliefs and behavior. He is the founding publisher of <i>Skeptic</i> magazine, the editor of Skeptic.com, a monthly columnist for <i>Scientific American</i>, and an adjunct professor at Claremont Graduate University. He lives in Southern California.</p>From <i>The Science of Good and Evil:</i><br><br>Examples of pre-moral sentiments among animals abound. Vampire bats share food and follow the principal of reciprocity. They go out at night in hoards seeking large sleeping mammals from which they can suck blood. Not all are successful, yet all need to eat regularly because of their excessively high metabolism. On average, older experienced bats fail one night in ten, younger inexperienced bats fail one night in three. Their solution is that successful hunters regurgitate blood and share it with their less fortunate comrades, fully expecting reciprocity the next time they come home sans bacon. Of course, the bats are not aware they are being cooperative in any conscious sense. All animals, including human animals, are just trying to survive, and it turns out that cooperation is a good strategy.<br></p><h2>Greatest Flying Stories Ever Told: Nineteen Amazing Tales From The Sky</h2><p>At 10:35 in the morning of Thursday, December 17, 1903, man got his wings. On the sand dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Orville Wright flew the motorized aircraft he and his brother Wilbur had constructed to a distance less than the length of the wingspan of today's 747 jet. They made three other flights the same day, the final lasting 59 seconds for a distance over the ground of 852 feet. The world would never be the same after that day. Mankind was finally off the ground in powered flight. And man's experiences in the air would forevermore join the literature of human endeavors, to be shared by kindred spirits as well as the curious sorts who have wanted to know, "What was it like up there?"<br><br>In THE GREATEST FLYING STORIES EVER TOLD, editor Lamar Underwood has collected some of the finest writings, both fact and realistic fiction, to lay bare the drama of human beings coping with the skills needed to direct their machines through the vastness of the skies. With contributions from: Charles Lindbergh, Ernest K. Gann, General Chuck Yeager, Leo Janos, Tom Wolfe, Mary Lovell, Richard Bach, Rinker Buck, Diane Ackerman, Derek Robinson, and more. <br></p><p><b>LAMAR UNDERWOOD</b> is the former editor-in-chief of <i>Sports Afield</i> and <i>Outdoor Life </i>and is presently the editorial director of the Outdoor Magazine Group of Harris Publications in New York. He is the author of the novel <i>On Dangerous Ground</i> published by Doubleday in 1989 and is the editor of several Lyons Press anthologies, including <i>The Greatest War Stories Ever Told</i>, <i>The Greatest Adventure Stories Ever Told</i>, <i>Tales of the Mountain Men</i>, <i>The Quotable Soldier</i>, <i>The Quotable Writer </i>and others on hunting, fishing and the outdoors. He is currently completing the anthology <i>The Greatest Submarine Stories Ever Told</i>, due to be published by The Lyons Press in the spring of 2004. Although not a licensed pilot, Lamar is an avid aviation buff who flies every chance he gets and reads about flying when stuck on the ground, between time spent running computer flight simulation programs and watching films, tapes and DVDs. This book stems from his deep love of flying and his firm belief that one of the greatest things about flying is that not very many people can do it-safely and with great skill. Those that can, to Lamar, are special people."Another in Lyons Press's first-rate greatest stories series."<i>--The Tampa Tribune</i><br> <br></p><h2>Aryan Sun Myths: The Origin of Religions</h2><p>Aryan Sun-Myths: The Origin of Religions by Sarah Elizabeth Titcomb, was originally published in 1889. The work looks at the central themes of Christianity and their pre-Christian Aryan roots by way of a comparative mythology with Egyptian, Hindu, Celtic, Buddhist, Aztec, and Arabian mythologies, inclduing the recurrent themes and symbols of the Tree of Life, Axis Mundi, Cross, and Virgin born saviour. Titcomb also points out the underlying seasonal agricultural and astronomical cycles in these theological systems.

The narrator, Abeer Ward (fragrant rose, in Arabic), daughter of a conservative family, admits wryly that her name is also the name of her father s flower shop. Abeer s bedroom window is filled by a view of a Coca-Cola sign featuring the image of her sexually adventurous friend, Jana.

That craving was for Coca Cola first-time novelist Alexandra Chreiteh asks us to see, with wonder, humor, and dismay, how inextricably confused naming and desire, identity and branding. The names and the novel s edgy, cynical humor might be recognizable across languages, cultures, and geographies. But Chreiteh s novel is first and foremost an exploration of a specific Lebanese milieu. Critics in Lebanon have responded in a storm, calling the novel an electric shock and finding that the problems of its characters reflect grave social anomalies.

These are universal practices, speaking to the human condition and helping us to become more aware and more loving individuals. <p>Mindfulness of Breathing </p><p>This practice is in four stages. After setting up our posture, we become more aware of our bodies and relax as deeply as possible. We become aware of the breath naturally flowing in and out, and then: </p><p>1. Count just after each out breath. Count up to ten breaths, and then start over at one. </p><p>2. As with the previous stage, but count just before each in breath. </p><p>3. Let go of the counting, simply following the breath. </p><p>4. Focus on the place where we first feel the breath entering and leaving our bodies (usually the rims of the nostrils). </p><p>Whenever we become aware that our minds have wandered, we let go of our distractions and come back to the breath once again. </p><p>Metta Bhavana Practice </p><p>"Metta" is essentially untranslatable. It means "love", "friendliness", "lovingkindness", and "empathy". It's an attitude of caring, concern, and cherishing. It's something we've all experienced to some degree or another. We experience metta every time we feel concerned about someone we know, or when we practice patience, or when we spontaneously help someone who is in difficulties. "Bhavana" means "cultivation" or "development", and so this is the practice of the "development of lovingkindness". It is based on the insight that all beings desire freedom from suffering. </p><p>The metta bhavana is in five stages. As always, we begin by setting up our posture, becoming more aware of our body and relaxing as deeply as we can. We become aware of our emotions, accepting that whatever we feel is where we are starting from. </p><p>We then:<br> 1. Cultivate metta (love, care, forgiveness, etc) towards ourselves.<br> 2. Cultivate metta for a good friend.<br> 3. Cultivate metta for a "neutral person" (someone we don't have any strong feelings for).<br> 4. Cultivate metta for someone that we experience conflict with, or for whom we feel ill will.<br> 5. Cultivate metta for all beings capable of experiencing suffering and of desiring well being. </p><p>Walking meditation </p><p>Walking meditation is an unstructured practice where we use the experience of walking as an object of awareness &#x2014; being aware of our bodies, our feelings and emotions, our thoughts, and our senses. If our mind wanders, we bring it back to our present experience. This helps us to remain "in the moment". </p><p>You can do walking meditation as part of a normal walk to work or to the grocery store, or you can set aside some special time to do the practice in the countryside or in a park. Other forms of walking meditation are described on the Wildmind site.</p>Bodhipaksa, who is originally from Scotland, has been practicing Buddhist meditation since 1982.</p><h2>20th-Century Theology: God and the World in a Transitional Age</h2><p><ul><li>Recipient of a <em>Christianity Today</em> 1993 Critics' Choice Award</li></ul> Now in paperback! Stanley Grenz and Roger Olson offer in this text a sympathetic introduction to twentieth-century theology and a critical survey of its significant thinkers and movements. Of particular interest is their attempt to show how twentieth-century theology has moved back and forth between two basic concepts: God's immanence and God's transcendence. Their survey profiles such towering figures in contemporary theology as Karl Barth, Rudolf Bultmann, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Reinhold Niebuhr, Paul Tillich, Jurgen Moltmann and Wolfhart Pannenberg. It critiques significant movements like neo-orthodoxy, process theology, liberation theology and theology of hope. And it assesses recent developments in feminist theology, black theology, new Catholic theology, narrative theology and evangelical theology. An indispensable handbook for anybody interested in today's theological landscape.</p><p>&#39;This book tells the complex story of modern theology in a critically discerning way--no small feat itself. Second it provides a useful key for interpreting these developments through the biblical dialectic of God&#39;s transcendence and immanence--a terrific idea in my view. Third, it demonstrates that evangelical theology is at last coming of age--thank God. No other book offers three benefits of this magnitude at this or any other price.&#39; Clark H.

This book is a rare exception. There is a powerful secret to be found within these pages. It claims to contain the hidden jewel that both Eastern and Western religions have been seeking for centuries. Religions have lost their focus, having turned their attention away from this mystical process and toward their dogmatic theologies. The Golden Flower, in terms of this book, is the hidden light within the human body that is the key to spiritual enlightenment. This book reveals how the reader can tap into it using meditative and Taoist Yoga practices. This can result in higher wisdom, spiritual bliss and a complete transformation of consciousness. It includes a Commentary by the legendary psychologist C.G. Jung concerning the differences in consciousness between the East and West, as well as his closing Appendix honoring the memory and accomplishments of the original Translator of this work, Richard Wilhelm.</p><p></p><h2>All Sales Final (Good Buy Girls)</h2><p><b>Maggie&#x2019;s impending wedding finds her more concerned with a cold case than cold feet in the latest from the author of <i>Marked Down for Murder</i> . . .</b><br><br>There&#x2019;s something 100% off about Maggie and her fianc� Sam&#x2019;s new dream home in the historic section of St. Stanley.

She knew her voice had reached a whiney pitch but she didn&#x2019;t care enough to try and make it less grating. Her feet hurt, her back ached and she was pretty sure she&#x2019;d pulled a muscle in her butt, trying to wriggle into the last dress Ginger had foisted upon her.</p><p>&#x201c;Maggie Gerber, you are not walking down the aisle to Sam Collins in a dress you already own,&#x201d; Ginger Lancaster said. A fine sheen of sweat coated her dark complexion; clearly Maggie wasn&#x2019;t the only one exerting herself in this quest for the perfect bridal gown.</p><p>Maggie had refused to wear white. She was in her forties. She&#x2019;d already been married and had a grown daughter, and wearing white just seemed too ing�nue to her. Unfortunately, her auburn hair and pale freckled skin ruled out a lot of color options.</p><p>Then there was the issue that Maggie was a founder of a self-named group of bargain hunters called the Good Buy Girls, who pretty much lived for savings and thrift. She simply could not spend a fortune on a dress she was going to wear for just one day. It went against the code.</p><p>If it had been left up to Maggie, she would have worn the gown she had worn to the Madison Ball in December, but her friends wouldn&#x2019;t hear of it.</p><p>&#x201c;Ginger&#x2019;s right.

She glanced up from the stroller that carried her baby girl Patience, or as her daddy liked to call her, Patty Cake.</p><p>&#x201c;And the olive color, while gorgeous in December, is a bit somber for a June wedding,&#x201d; Claire Freemont chimed in. &#x201c;Not to mention the back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What back?&#x201d; Ginger asked and they all broke out laughing. &#x201c;Oh yeah, Pastor Shields would keel over dead if he got a gander at all that skin in his house of worship.&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie heaved a sigh. &#x201c;I could wear a veil that would cover the open back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. Just no,&#x201d; Ginger said and shook her head at her.</p><p>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;But I look like Tinker Bell in this thing so it&#x2019;s a no, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I think it&#x2019;s cute,&#x201d; Joanne said.</p><p>Maggie glanced at her friend. Clearly, she was suffering from some postpartum fashion impairment. The bodice of the dress Maggie currently had on was sparkly silver and the skirt looked like a puffy tutu in layers of pink and purple tulle. She wouldn&#x2019;t have been caught dead in this dress, and she was pretty sure Ginger had only made her put it on to amuse herself. One glance at Ginger&#x2019;s face, which was contorted from trying not to laugh, confirmed it.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; Maggie said. She spun a sloppy pirouette in the dressing room&#x2019;s three-way mirror. &#x201c;It is cute. You know, I think I&#x2019;ll take it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gah! What?&#x201d; Ginger squawked.</p><p>&#x201c;Aha!&#x201d; Maggie pointed at her. &#x201c;You were pranking me with this dress.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe, a little,&#x201d; Ginger said. She looked down. &#x201c;Claire bet me five bucks I couldn&#x2019;t get you to try it on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; Maggie gasped. &#x201c;Claire!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Claire asked. She pushed her black glasses up on her nose. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the one who&#x2019;s out five bucks. I don&#x2019;t know why you&#x2019;re upset. Besides we&#x2019;ve been at this for five hours. We&#x2019;ve hit every bridal store within a fifty mile radius of St. Stanley. Honestly, how can we not have found you a reasonably priced but still amazing dress yet?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;But this poufy sparkly thing is giving me a headache.&#x201d; She glanced at the skin on her chest. &#x201c;And possibly a rash.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Here, let&#x2019;s get you out of it,&#x201d; Ginger said and she spun Maggie around and unzipped her.</p><p>Maggie sucked in a deep gulp of air and ducked behind the curtain to get dressed. When she returned with the offending dress and three other rejects on her arm, she handed them to the waiting saleslady and signaled to the girls that it was time to go.</p><p>As they passed a bride and her mother, Maggie felt a pang in her chest. She missed her daughter, Laura, who was doing an internship in New York City this summer. Oh, she&#x2019;d be in Virginia to stand up for Maggie at the wedding, and Maggie knew that Laura loved Sam and was happy for them, but her baby girl would be finishing college soon and was starting her own life. It was one of the many changes Maggie had been trying to adjust to over the past few months.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; Ginger said as she draped her arm over Maggie&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only May; we have almost a month to find your perfect dress.&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie returned her friend&#x2019;s half hug. She didn&#x2019;t have the heart to tell her that it wasn&#x2019;t just the dress that had her fretting. She and Sam had decided to start their new life in a new house, a place that they owned together, which would be a new beginning for both of them. While she was thrilled by the idea of a fresh start, leaving her home of more than twenty years was harder than she had thought it would be.</p><p>&#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; she said. She didn&#x2019;t want to burden her friends with all of her thoughts. &#x201c;No worries.&#x201d;</p><p>Joanne had been the designated driver since she needed Patience&#x2019;s car seat. They all piled into her SUV with Ginger sitting next to Patience so she could coo at the baby while they drove. As the mother of four teen boys, Ginger could not get enough of the precious baby girl.</p><p>&#x201c;If not ivory or white, then what color do you want to wear to your wedding?&#x201d; Claire asked from the front passenger seat. &#x201c;I can research customs for second weddings for you at the library. Maybe there is something mystical about wearing red or purple.&#x201d;</p><p>Claire glanced over her seat back at Maggie. With her blond bob and rectangular black glasses, Claire looked just like the librarian that she was. She was always the one to answer a conundrum with research and Maggie valued her for it.</p><p>&#x201c;That might give us some interesting ideas,&#x201d; Joanne said. &#x201c;Maybe yellow could be your go-to color.&#x201d;</p><p>She tossed her long brown braid over her shoulder and met Maggie&#x2019;s gaze in the rearview mirror, then her eyes darted to the baby just to be sure her girl was fine. It had taken Joanne and her husband, Michael, a long time to conceive and Maggie frequently caught her friend staring at her baby girl in wonder. She understood the feeling well.</p><p>&#x201c;Yellow?&#x201d; Maggie asked. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if that color is always kind to redheads.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just be thankful that your only issue is finding a dress. I&#x2019;ve been reading up on international wedding customs and there are some doozies,&#x201d; Claire said. &#x201c;In Fiji, the groom must present his prospective father-in-law with a whale tooth. Biggest mammal going and it lives under water, how&#x2019;s that for proving your love?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sam is getting off easy,&#x201d; Ginger said.</p><p>&#x201c;There is also a tribal custom in northern Borneo where the newly married couples are required to be confined to their house while not going to the bathroom for three days and nights,&#x201d; Claire said. &#x201c;Now that&#x2019;s commitment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Suddenly, finding an appropriate dress does not seem as much of a challenge as it did a few minutes ago,&#x201d; Maggie said. She grinned at her friend. &#x201c;Thank you, Claire.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re quite welcome,&#x201d; Claire said.</p><p>&#x201c;How do you know all of these things?&#x201d; Ginger asked. &#x201c;It mystifies.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We information scientists are full of useful facts,&#x201d; Claire said. &#x201c;I know a few more unusual customs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, no, I think we&#x2019;re good.&#x201d; Ginger held up one hand. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to ruin my lunch.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you drop me off at the station, Joanne?&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;Sam and I have an appointment with Marcy Hayes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No problem, what property are you looking at today?&#x201d; Joanne asked.</p><p>Maggie glanced at her friends. She wondered how they were going to take the news. She could still hear her mother&#x2019;s gasp of horror from when she&#x2019;d spoken to her on the phone last night. Well, there wasn&#x2019;t any way to sugarcoat it.</p><p>&#x201c;The Dixon place,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>The rest of the the Good Buy Girls looked at her with wide eyes. They wore matching expressions of disbelief and not the sort that meant they&#x2019;d found a Louis Vuitton handbag in perfect condition at 75% off. Instead, they looked as though they&#x2019;d found an imitation Coach bag for sale but still priced at more than its retail value.</p><p>&#x201c;I know what you&#x2019;re going to say,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;My mother let me have it with both barrels last night.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That the place has been empty for over five years and there&#x2019;s probably a family of skunks living in it,&#x201d; Ginger said. Obviously, there was no warning her off of the subject.</p><p>&#x201c;There are no varmints living in it,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;At least, I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well how about the fact that the yard is so overgrown it&#x2019;s begun to swallow up the neighborhood pets that stray too close to the picket fence, which is falling down,&#x201d; Claire said.</p><p>&#x201c;A landscaper was over there last week, making everything nice and tidy again,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;As far as I know, they found no carcasses of missing pets.&#x201d;</p><p>Joanne didn&#x2019;t say anything and Maggie met her gaze in the rearview mirror. Her friend looked worried.</p><p>&#x201c;What is it, Joanne?&#x201d; Maggie asked. &#x201c;You may as well say your piece, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; she said with a forced smile.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a terrible liar, Joanne,&#x201d; Ginger said. &#x201c;Go ahead and say it. We&#x2019;re all thinking it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I heard it&#x2019;s haunted,&#x201d; Joanne said. She clamped her lips together quickly as if by closing her mouth she could disassociate herself from her own words.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s just a rumor,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;Of course people think it&#x2019;s haunted. It&#x2019;s been in the Dixon family for generations with its last residents being two spinster sisters. I think that means it has a rich family history. I don&#x2019;t think it means it&#x2019;s haunted.&#x201d;</p><p>They were all quiet as Joanne navigated the winding road back to town.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; Ginger said. &#x201c;But are you willing to risk it?&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Sam Collins was waiting outside the station when Joanne pulled up to let Maggie out. As always, Maggie&#x2019;s heart beat a little faster at the sight of him. His brown hair was peppered with gray, and his bright blue eyes had crinkles in the corners, but he was still as big and strong as he had been when he was eighteen and Maggie was seventeen and they&#x2019;d fallen in love the first time around.</p><p>More than twenty years and a lot of living had kept them apart but Sam had moved back to St. Stanley after retiring from the Richmond PD. He was sheriff for their small town and as circumstances had thrown them together over the past year and then some, he and Maggie had discovered they had unfinished business. Now they were getting married. It boggled.</p><p>As Maggie climbed out of the car, Ginger quickly grabbed her and held her still. Then she took off the cross she always wore around her neck and pressed it into Maggie&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Just in case,&#x201d; Ginger said.</p><p>Maggie rolled her eyes but draped the necklace over her head to hang around her neck just to make her best friend since preschool happy.</p><p>&#x201c;Text us,&#x201d; Claire said. &#x201c;ASAP.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, anytime,&#x201d; Joanne added. &#x201c;You know I&#x2019;m up all night.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;But yes, I promise I&#x2019;ll check in.&#x201d;</p><p>She waved as the van pulled away. Sam joined her at the curb and gave her a quick hug.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up with the thrifty three?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Ghosts,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>Sam frowned at her. &#x201c;Whose?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ours. They are concerned that we are looking at a haunted house,&#x201d; Maggie said.</p><p>&#x201c;The Dixon house?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Nah, it just needs a little love, or possibly a wrecking ball.&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie laughed. &#x201c;I like your flexibility. Let&#x2019;s not keep Marcy waiting. I swear she almost swooned when I told her we would look at it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you tell her we were bringing a third opinion?&#x201d; Sam asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No, I thought I&#x2019;d leave that to you,&#x201d; Maggie said.</p><p>Sam smiled. He led Maggie to the car and opened the door. Curled up on the passenger seat waiting for them was Marshall Dillon, Sam&#x2019;s cat, who was now their shared cat. A gray tabby with a distinctive stripe in the shape of an <i>M</i> on his forehead, he liked to ride around in Sam&#x2019;s squad car and spent most of his days in the station. Maggie was pretty sure Sam would have deputized him if he could.</p><p>Maggie scooped Marshall Dillon up and then sat down, replacing him on her lap. Sam took the driver&#x2019;s seat and they buckled up and headed over to the historic part of town.</p><p>The Dixon house was one of the oldest houses in St. Stanley. It wasn&#x2019;t as big as some of the mansions on the street but it was a beautiful two-story Victorian with a wraparound porch and arch-shaped windows on the upper level. Maggie had always admired it and she had even occasionally daydreamed about having a place like this of her very own.</p><p>The grass was freshly mowed and the bushes had been trimmed back, but it still had an untamed air about it. The house badly needed a coat of fresh paint and the windows longed for some elbow grease but the bones were all there. Like any aging beauty, with a little upkeep, Maggie felt certain it would be spectacular again.</p><p>Sam pulled up in front of the house. Maggie carried Marshall Dillon to the front porch where Marcy Hayes was waiting.</p><p>Marcy was a very earnest woman, a single mom with two teenagers. She worked seven days a week doing listings, showings and open houses, all in an effort to provide since her husband ran off with a woman half his age and was selfish enough to clean out their bank account on his way out of town.</p><p>Maggie glanced at Sam as they climbed the steps to the porch. He didn&#x2019;t seem the type to have a midlife crisis but then she was pretty sure Marcy would have said the same thing about her husband. She glanced at the house. If Sam did leave her, would she want to live here alone?</p><p>Marshall Dillon hissed which made Maggie jump and she let him go. He leapt down onto the porch with the scruff of his neck in an agitated ruff and his tail fluffed.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, hello there, little fella.&#x201d;</p><p>Marcy knelt down and wiggled her fingers at Marshall Dillon then made kissy noises. Maggie did not think Marshall Dillon was going to go for this in the least but he lowered his head and plowed toward Marcy, not stopping until she was scratching him under the chin and he was purring. His fur slowly lowered from its full alert state.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you suppose that was about?&#x201d; Maggie asked Sam.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe he smelled another cat in the area. The place has been empty for a while. It could be we have some feral cats living under the porch.&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie looked at him. &#x201c;I like the way you&#x2019;ve already mentally moved in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Noticed that, huh?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>Marcy rose to her feet and Marshall Dillon twined around her ankle.</p><p>&#x201c;He is just precious,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I think he&#x2019;d really love having such a big house to play in, and maybe you could even get him a friend.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We were thinking about a dog,&#x201d; Sam said.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, the backyard is just perfect for a dog,&#x201d; Marcy said. &#x201c;So much room to run and play.&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie pressed her lips together. She had a feeling they could say they were going to breed elephants and Marcy would find a way to make the house the perfect location for them.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go inside and I&#x2019;ll give you the room-by-room tour,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>Sam gestured for Maggie to follow Marcy first. She had a feeling Marcy wasn&#x2019;t going to have to work too hard to sell Sam on the place. As for her...</p></p><h2>Dogs, Vol. 8 (8)</h2><p>An action-packed, stylish shoot-&#x2019;em-up.<br><br>Boasting furious action, switchback plotting, magnetic characters and dazzling art, Dogs tells the story of four individuals struggling to survive a dystopian urban future by gun and sword and courage and luck. <br><br> The devastating assault launched from the Below creates unrest among the residents of the Underground.

It&#x2019;s cold as shit and dark from the clouds hanging low in the sky. No stars, no moon. Creepy, especially since I&#x2019;m standing out here alone.<br><br>If it starts to rain and she&#x2019;s not done working, forget it. I&#x2019;m leaving. I don&#x2019;t need this shit.<br><br>Panic sweeps through me and I take a deep breath. I can&#x2019;t leave and I know it. I need her. I don&#x2019;t even know her and she sure as hell doesn&#x2019;t know me, yet I need her to survive. I don&#x2019;t care if that sounds like I&#x2019;m a complete pussy or what; it&#x2019;s true.<br><br>No way can I face next week on my own.<br><br>The music from within the tiny bar thumps loudly and I can hear everyone inside laughing and shouting. I swear I recognize more than a few voices. They&#x2019;re having a good time. Midterms are going down and the majority of us should be studying, right? Chilling in the library or bent over our desks, our heads in a book or hunched over our laptops, rereading notes, writing papers, whatever.<br><br>Most of my friends are in that bar drunk off their asses instead. No one seems to care it&#x2019;s only Tuesday and there are still three more days left of testing and turning stuff in. It&#x2019;s make-or-break time, but everyone&#x2019;s focused on the fact that we&#x2019;re off next week. Most of us are hightailing it out of this shit small town where we go to college.<br><br>Like me. I&#x2019;m outta here by Saturday afternoon. Though I don&#x2019;t want to leave. I&#x2019;d rather stay here.<br><br>But I can&#x2019;t.<br><br>She&#x2019;s off work at midnight. I asked one of the other waitresses who work at La Salle&#x2019;s when I snuck in there earlier, before anyone had really arrived. She&#x2019;d been inside, working in the kitchen, so she didn&#x2019;t see me. Which was fine.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t want her to notice me. Not yet. And my so-called friends don&#x2019;t need to know what I&#x2019;m up to either. No one knows about my plan. I&#x2019;m afraid someone will talk me out of it if they did.<br><br>Like I have anyone to tell. It may look like I&#x2019;m surrounded by plenty of people I call my friends, but I&#x2019;m not close to any of them. I don&#x2019;t want to be. Getting too close to anyone only brings trouble.<br><br>The old wooden door swings open, creaking on its hinges, the noise from within coming at me like a physical blast as it smacks against my chest. She emerges into the darkness, the door slamming behind her, the sound echoing in the otherwise quiet night air. She&#x2019;s got on a short puffy red coat that almost swallows her whole, making her legs covered in black tights look extra long.<br><br>Pushing away from the wall, I approach her. &#x201c;Hey.&#x201d;<br><br>The wary glance she flicks in my direction says it all. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not interested.&#x201d;<br><br>Huh? &#x201c;But I didn&#x2019;t ask you anything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know what you want.&#x201d; She starts walking and I fall in behind her. Chasing her, really. I didn&#x2019;t plan on this. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re all the same. Thinking you can wait around here, hoping to catch me. Trap me. My reputation is far more outrageous than what I&#x2019;ve actually done with any of your friends,&#x201d; she tosses over her shoulder as she picks up speed. For such a little thing, she sure is fast.<br><br>Wait a minute. What she said, what&#x2019;s it supposed to mean? &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not looking for an easy mark.&#x201d;<br><br>She laughs, but the sound is brittle. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need<br><br>to lie, Drew Callahan. I know what you want from me.&#x201d;<br><br>At least she knows who I am. I snag her arm just as she&#x2019;s about to cross the street, stopping her in her tracks, and she turns to glare at me. My fingers tingle, even though all I&#x2019;m grabbing at is coat fabric. &#x201c;What do you think I want from you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sex.&#x201d; She spits the word out, her green eyes narrowed, her pale blond hair glowing from the shine of the streetlight we&#x2019;re standing under. &#x201c;Look, my feet are killing me and I&#x2019;m exhausted. You chose the wrong night to think you can get with me.&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;m totally confused. She&#x2019;s talking like she&#x2019;s some sort of paid prostitute and I&#x2019;m hoping to get a quickie blow job in an alley.<br><br>Drinking in her features, my gaze settles on her mouth. She has a great one. Full, sexy lips; she could probably give a most excellent blow job if I&#x2019;m being honest with myself, but that&#x2019;s not why I&#x2019;m here.<br><br>Makes me wonder exactly how many of my fellow teammates have got with her. I mean, true, the only reason I&#x2019;m talking to her is because of that reputation she mentioned. But I&#x2019;m not trying to buy her off for sex.<br><br>I&#x2019;m trying to buy her off for protection.<br><br>Fable [noun]: a story not founded on fact; an untruth; falsehood.<br><br>Campus golden boy Drew Callahan is holding onto me like he&#x2019;s never going to let go and he&#x2019;s making me nervous. He&#x2019;s huge, well over six feet, and with shoulders as broad as a mountain. Considering he plays football, that&#x2019;s no surprise, right? And I&#x2019;ve made out with a few of the guys from his team. They&#x2019;re all pretty muscly and big.<br><br>But not a one of them makes my heart race just by grabbing my arm. I don&#x2019;t like how I react to him. I don&#x2019;t usually react to anyone.<br><br>With all the strength I can muster, I tug out of his grip and step away from him, gaining some much-needed distance. A sort of pleading light flickers in his eyes and I part my lips, ready to tell him to fuck off, when he beats me to the punch.<br><br>&#x201c;I need your help.&#x201d;<br><br>Frowning, I rest my hands on my hips. Which is sort of hard, considering the stupid bulky coat I&#x2019;m wearing. It&#x2019;s cold outside and the flimsy skirt I wear for work is allowing a major draft to coast up my legs. Thank God for wool tights, though I know my boss hates them. He says they&#x2019;re not very sexy.<br><br>I could give a crap about what he says when it comes to what&#x2019;s sexy. My tips are still good. I have over one hundred dollars in my purse from tonight. It&#x2019;s already spent, though.<br><br>My money is always spent before I actually get it in my hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Why do you need my help?&#x201d; I ask.<br><br>He glances around, as if afraid someone might see us. No surprise. Most guys don&#x2019;t want to be seen with me in public.<br><br>Sometimes it really sucks, being the campus slut. Especially when I don&#x2019;t even go to that stupid university.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe we could go somewhere and talk,&#x201d; he suggests with a slight smile. I&#x2019;m sure most girls would melt at first sight of that smile, the beguiling look on his face. It&#x2019;s a beautiful face and he knows it, with those dark eyebrows that match his brown hair and the striking blue eyes.<br><br>But I&#x2019;m not most girls. I don&#x2019;t fall for a bunch of crap. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going anywhere with you to talk. If you have something to say, you can do it right here. Be quick with it, too, because I need to go home.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m pretty sure my mom isn&#x2019;t there and my little brother is all alone.<br><br>Not good.<br><br>He blows out a harsh breath, sounding all irritated. I don&#x2019;t care. Whatever he has to say can&#x2019;t be something I&#x2019;d consider. I&#x2019;m too curious, though, so I need to know. Just so I can savor it later.<br><br>Drew Callahan does not talk to girls like me. I&#x2019;m a local. A townie. He&#x2019;s the quarterback of our winning university football team. He&#x2019;s like a superstar, larger than life, with fans and everything. He has NFL aspirations, for the love of God.<br><br>I work a shitty job and can barely make ends meet. My mom is an alcoholic who sleeps around and my little brother is starting to get into trouble at school. Our worlds are such total opposites. I don&#x2019;t have a clue why he would want to talk to me.<br><br>&#x201c;Thanksgiving break is next week,&#x201d; he starts out, and I roll my eyes.<br><br>Duh. I&#x2019;m extra thankful for it, too. It means everyone will vacate this town and the bar will be virtually empty, making work a breeze. &#x201c;Go on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have to go back home.&#x201d; He pauses, his gaze cutting away from mine, and uneasiness slips down my spine. I have no idea what this has to do with me. &#x201c;I want you to go with me.&#x201d;<br><br>Okay. That I didn&#x2019;t expect. &#x201c;What? Why?&#x201d;<br><br>His gaze meets mine once more. &#x201c;I want you to pretend to be my girlfriend for a week.&#x201d;<br><br>I gape at him. I feel like a dying fish. Closing my lips, opening them. As if I&#x2019;m gasping for my last breath, which I sorta feel like I&#x2019;m doing. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding.&#x201d;<br><br>He slowly shakes his head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I . . .&#x201d; He shakes his head and clamps his lips shut, as if he doesn&#x2019;t want to tell me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pay you.&#x201d;<br><br>I cross my arms in front of my chest. They&#x2019;re elevated from the stupid puffy jacket. I hate it so much, but it&#x2019;s the warmest coat I own. I bet I look like a blimp. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not for sale.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Listen, I don&#x2019;t want to pay you for anything&#x2014;sexual.&#x201d; His voice drops an octave and chills scatter all over my skin. The way he said that was sexy, though he didn&#x2019;t mean to be. &#x201c;I just need you to pretend to be my girlfriend. We won&#x2019;t have to share a room or anything like that. I&#x2019;m not going to try and get in your pants, but we&#x2019;ll have to look like we&#x2019;re together, you know what I mean?&#x201d;<br><br>No answer. I want him to continue this so I can remember later how I had Drew freaking Callahan begging me to be his pretend girlfriend. The moment couldn&#x2019;t get any more surreal than it already is.<br><br>&#x201c;I know you have a life and a job and whatever else that you do. It&#x2019;ll probably be hard for you to ditch everything and go away with me for a week, but I swear, I&#x2019;ll make it worth your time.&#x201d;<br><br>He makes me feel cheap with that last remark. Like I&#x2019;m the whore every guy brags that I am. The exaggerations are out there. The stories are so outrageous, I don&#x2019;t bother denying them. There&#x2019;s no point. &#x201c;How much are you talking?&#x201d;<br><br>His gaze locks with mine and I&#x2019;m trapped. Anticipation curls through me as I wait for his answer.<br><br>&#x201c;Three thousand dollars.&#x201d;</p><h2>Zuni Fetishes: Using Native American Sacred Objects for Meditation, Reflection, and Insight</h2><p><p>The Zuni have traditionally used small stone carvings of animal figures as power objects and mediators between themselves and the spirit world. Any object that has special meaning can be used as a fetish. In this fascinating, informative, and beautifully illustrated guide to the fetishes of the Zuni people of New Mexico, Hal Zina Bennett explores key principles of Native American spirituality and how early Zuni teachings can benefit us all today. He provides an excellent guide to Zuni traditions and an intriguing picture of their early life, along with detailed instructions for using fetishes for mediation, reflection, and insight in modern life. He describes key fetish figures, including the Guardian of the Six Regions, their legendary meanings, and the personal qualities each figure can support and help its owner develop. </p><p>In explaining the nature of fetishes and the psychological and spiritual benefits that we can gain from their use, Bennett provides illuminating cross-cultural comparisons, stimulating exercises, and journaling opportunities.</p></p><p><p>Hal Zina Bennett, Ph.D., is a lecturer, consultant, and the author or co-author of twenty-seven books, including <em>The Lens of Perception, The Well Body Book</em> (with Mike Samuels, M.D.), <em>The Holotropic Mind</em> (with Stanislav Grof, M.D.), and <em>Follow Your Bliss</em> (with Susan J.

Never before or since have four teams tied for the lead in baseball's final month. The stakes were high--there were no playoffs, the pennant winner went directly to the World Series.<br> Here, for the first time, all four teams are treated as equals. The author describes their contrasting skill sets, leadership and temperament. The stress of such stiff and sustained competition was constant, and there were overt psychological and physical intimidations playing a major role throughout the season. The standings were volatile and so were emotions. The players and managers varied: some wilted or broke, others responded heroically.</p><p>A lifelong sports fan, <b>Cameron Bright</b> lives in Freeport, Maine."History is often written by, or to honor, the winners. There have been a dozen books on the 1967 Impossible Dream Red Sox, the team that prevailed in that year's pennant race. Cameron Bright takes the story further and shows us just what a race it truly was, giving equal time to the four teams that battled down to the final weekend. Filled with portrayals of the players and managers involved, his book enriches our appreciation for one of the hardest-fought drives in baseball history." --Bill Nowlin, author of <i>Tom Yawkey: Patriarch of the Boston Red Sox</i></p><h2>Men on the Moon: Collected Short Stories (Volume 37) (Sun Tracks)</h2><p><b>When Faustin, the old Acoma,</b> is given his first television set, he considers it a technical wonder, a box full of mystery. What he sees on its screen that first day, however, is even more startling than the television itself: men have landed on the moon. Can this be real? For Simon Ortiz, Faustin's reaction proves that tales of ordinary occurrences can truly touch the heart. "For me," he observes, "there's never been a conscious moment without story."<br><br> Best known for his poetry, Ortiz also has authored 26 short stories that have won the hearts of readers through the years. <i>Men on the Moon</i> brings these stories together&#x2014;stories filled with memorable characters, written with love by a keen observer and interpreter of his people's community and culture. True to Native American tradition, these tales possess the immediacy&#x2014;and intimacy&#x2014;of stories conveyed orally. They are drawn from Ortiz's Acoma Pueblo experience but focus on situations common to Native people, whether living on the land or in cities, and on the issues that affect their lives. We meet Jimmo, a young boy learning that his father is being hunted for murder, and Kaiser, the draft refuser who always wears the suit he was given when he left prison. We also meet some curious Anglos: radicals supporting Indian causes, scholars studying Indian ways, and San Francisco hippies who want to become Indians too.<br><br> Whether telling of migrants working potato fields in Idaho and pining for their Arizona home or of a father teaching his son to fly a kite, Ortiz takes readers to the heart of storytelling. <i>Men on the Moon</i> shows that stories told by a poet especially resound with beauty and depth.</p><p>Poet, fiction writer, essayist, and storyteller Simon Ortiz is a native of Acoma Pueblo and is the author of numerous books.Ortiz (After and Before the Lightning) is best known as a foremost contemporary Native American poet; his short fiction, written with a poetic emphasis on dense, potent language, is collected here for the first time. These 26 storiesApenned between the late '60s and the early '80sAdemonstrate the diversity of Native experience in modern America. Speaking in homage to, and solidarity with, his own Acoma Pueblo heritage, the author depicts American Indians in a wide range of social and geographic settings, from reservations to urban landscape. Many tales are melancholy, as they trace the fates of maligned, misunderstood and often visionary characters. In the title story, an aged Pueblo man watches television for the first time, sees astronauts walk on the moon and senses a sudden, irreversible loss of mystery. A young war widow takes a job at an Indian boarding school and must say good-bye to family and friends in the short "Home Country." Another tale, set in Oklahoma, juxtaposes generations in another way, as two brothers listen to an old drunk tell the story of Tecumseh's war; they know that Indians today need a new vision of themselves, another story that can build a powerful Indian identity. A sense of gentleness and wonder pervades the piece in which a father builds his son his first kite and watches the boy's exhilaration. The language of these rich narratives reflect both Ortiz's poetic gift and his intimate knowledge of oral storytelling.

Many promote one view as the only reasonable solution. But what are the main viewpoints, and just why do they disagree? In the midst of an increasingly intense dispute, Gerald Rau answers the important questions with level-headed clarity and evenhanded analysis. Rau lays out six models of origins, ranging from naturalistic evolution to young-earth creation. He shows how each model presupposes an underlying philosophy that adherents take on faith. With the sensitivity of a seasoned educator, Rau demonstrates how each model assesses the scientific evidence in relation to four different kinds of origins: the universe, life, species and humans. In an age of specialists, Rau sees the big picture. <em>Mapping the Origins Debate</em> cuts through the cacophony and the complexity to provide a lucid and charitable contribution to the conversation.</p><p><strong>Gerald Rau</strong> (Ph.D., Cornell) is founder and chief editor at Professional English International, Inc., based at National Chung Cheng University in Chiayi, Taiwan. He was previously an adjunct professor teaching biology courses at Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois, and at Trinity Christian College in Palos Heights, Illinois."Gerald Rau has, I believe, done a great service by producing a lucid introduction to the subject by 'mapping' the arguments from all sides, summarising the data in such a way that we can get a handle on what different people believe and why they believe it." (Alan J.F. Fraser, The Record, September 2013)<br><br>"Written for nonspecialists, the book should appeal to both students and to grown-ups who, like me, daydreamed their way through high-school science courses." (Matt Reynolds, Christianity Today, April 2013)<br><br>"The thoughtful and comprehensive description of the range of positions on origins that is presented would be enough for me to highly recommend this book. Dr. Gerry Rau's exploration of the origins debate is made even more valuable by a helpful description of the nature of science, a careful exploration of the assumptions and associated conclusions of each position, and a fair and objective presentation throughout." (Raymond J. Lewis, associate professor of biology, Wheaton College)<br><br>"It's about time a book like this hit the market! No caricatures of 'them,' no hackneyed stereotypes of 'the other side,' this is an honest assessment of where the debate lies. Although an expert himself, Dr. Rau shows his seasoned pedagogical skills and does not lose nonspecialist readers in unnecessary technical jargon. If you've suspected that there are more options than just creationism or philosophical materialism, this book is for you." (Nicholas G. Piotrowski, Crossroads Bible College)<br><br>"Unlike other multiple-views volumes prevalent across the evangelical scholarly spectrum in which contributors attempt to convince others of their views, this book invites readers to understand the religious and scientific logic at work amid the disputes. Rau maps not only the origins debate but also the diversity of scientific presuppositions and methodologies. <em>Mapping</em> has the potential to reorient the evangelical discussion and set it in a constructive direction." (Amos Yong, J. Rodman Williams Professor of Theology, Regent University, School of Divinity, Virginia Beach, Virginia)<br><br>"Eminently qualified with advanced degrees in genetics and science education from top universities, Dr. Gerald Rau not only aims to present the arguments for each position as neutrally as possible, he actually succeeds where angels, let alone countless other scholars, have feared or failed to tread. His thoughtful Christian voice rings clearly in the midst of an often shrill debate where too many are unwilling to acknowledge how their respective worldviews shape their interpretations of scientific data." (Robert Osburn, Ph.D., executive director, Wilberforce Academy, adjunct professor, University of Minnesota)<br><br>"<em>Mapping the Origins Debate</em> offers readers a helpful map of the confusing and noisy terrain of America's troubled conversation about origins. Readers will appreciate Gerald Rau's calm and reasoned guide to the debate; he provides light in an area where most books offer only heat." (Karl Giberson, professor of science religion, Stonehill College, author, The Wonder of the Universe: Hints of God in our Fine-Tuned World)<br><br>"Rau's book is an indispensable resource in understanding the logic and structure of other models that one may disagree with. It also provides a wealth of resources for further reading and research. It is an original and erudite contribution to the science and theology dialogue. It also serves well to outline several of the philosophical assumptions that function as a mediator between the two. I know of no other text that explores such a vast amount of material dealing specifically with origins in such a tightly knit package. I highly recommend this work to not only philosophers, scientists and theologians but to anyone interested in the debates revolving around origins." (Scott Ventureyra, Science et Espirit)<br><br>"Both the novice and the seasoned student of the origins debate will find Rau's book to be an indispensable resource."

This illuminating anthology provides a window into the country from the perspective of thirty-two expatriates from seven different nations artists, entrepreneurs, Peace Corps volunteers, archaeologists, missionaries, and others who established lives in Turkey for work, love, or adventure. Through narrative essays covering the last four decades, these diverse women unveil the mystique of the Orient,&#x201d; describe religious conflict, embrace cultural discovery, and maneuver familial traditions, customs, and responsibilities. Poignant, humorous, and transcendent, the essays take readers to weddings and workplaces, down cobbled Byzantine streets, into boisterous bazaars along the Silk Road, and deep into the feminine stronghold of steamy Ottoman bathhouses. The outcome is a stunning collection of voices from women suspended between two homes as they redefine their identities and reshape their worldviews.</p><p>Anastasia M. Ashman is a career essayist specializing in personal tales of cultural adventure. She has spent ten years working for literary agents and producers of film, television, and Broadway theaterExcerpt from Introduction <p>If there were ever a place tailor-made to play host to wanderers, travelers and those pursuing lives outside their original territory, surely Turkey is that place. The perpetual evolution that travel and cultural assimilation visits upon the foreign born women in this collection echoes the continuous transformation that envelops the entire country. Threshold to worlds East or West depending on which way one faces, Turkey is itself a unique metaphor for transition. Forming a geographic bridge between the continents of Europe and Asia and a philosophical link between the spheres of Occident and Orient, Turkey is neither one of the places it connects. Similarly, foreign women on Turkish soil are neither what nor who they used to be, yet not fully transformed by their brush with Turkey. Our <b>Expat Harem</b> women are on the brink of reclassifying themselves, challenged to redefine their lives, to rethink their definitions of spirituality, femininity, sensuality and self. Aligned in their ever-shifting contexts, both Turkey and the expatriate share a bond of constant metamorphosis. </p><p>Delirious with influenza, a friendless Australian realizes the value of <i>misafir perverlik</i>, traditional Turkish hospitality, when she&#x2019;s rescued from her freezing rental by unknown Anatolian neighbors bearing food and medicinal tea; a pregnant and introverted Irishwoman faces the challenge of finding her place in a large Black Sea family; a Peace Corps volunteer in remote Eastern Turkey realizes how the taboos of her own culture color her perceptions; and a liberated New York single questions the gallant rules of engagement on the Istanbul dating scene, wondering whether being treated like a lady makes her less a feminist. </p><p>These are among the <b>Tales from the Expat Harem</b>. The titillating, anachronistic title acknowledges erroneous yet prevalent Western stereotypes about Asia Minor and the entire Muslim world, while also declaring that our storytellers share a common bond with the denizens of a traditional Turkish harem. Much like the imported brides of the Seraglio, Istanbul&#x2019;s 15th century palatial seat of the Ottoman sultanate, our writers are inextricably wedded to Turkish culture, embedded in it even, yet forever alien.</p></p><h2>Wild and Crooked</h2><p><p><b>Critically-acclaimed author Leah Thomas blends a small-town setting with the secrets of a long-ago crime, in a compelling novel about breaking free from the past.</b></p><p>In Samsboro, Kentucky, Kalyn Spence's name is inseparable from the brutal murder her father committed when he was a teenager.

In this compelling tale, we meet Kate�a popular religion professor at a liberal arts college in a small midwestern town who thinks her life is right on track. She loves her job, is happy with her personal and spiritual life, and her guilty pleasure consists of passing her afternoons at the local pub with a pint of Guinness and a cigarette. Life is good. </p> <p> Kate is up for tenure when it all starts to go wrong. A colleague warns her that her books are too Christian and too popular. She is offered a visiting professor job at a prestigious seminary, which sounds like the perfect solution except for one complication�it is the same seminary that employs the professor she had an affair with years ago. Kate now has to face her past and watch as the ramifications unfold in ways she never imagined. In the classroom, students ask for her views on Jesus, the Bible, and homosexuality, controversial topics that Kate candidly addresses until outraged parents start campaigning for the school to get rid of her. Through it all, Kate faces the toughest challenge yet�a crisis of faith that leaves her questioning what she believed so strongly before. </p> <p> <i>Putting Away Childish Things</i> is an engaging way for readers to learn about the important issues dividing Christians today. Along the way, we join with the characters to ask the hard questions such as what does the Bible really teach? Who is Jesus? What is the nature of faith today? </p> <p> This is a story that promises to leave us different in the end than when we started, as we learn how even in the twenty-first century, God works in mysterious ways. </p></p><p><p>Marcus J. Borg (1942&#x2013;2015) was a pioneering author and teacher whom the <em>New York Times</em> described as "a leading figure in his generation of Jesus scholars." He was the Hundere Distinguished Professor of Religion and Culture at Oregon State University and canon theologian at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Portland, and he appeared on NBC's <em>The Today Show</em> and <em>Dateline</em>, ABC's <em>World News</em>, and NPR's <em>Fresh Air</em>. His books have sold over a million copies, including the bestselling <em>Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time</em>, <em>Reading the Bible Again for the First Time</em>, <em>Jesus</em>, <em>The Heart of Christianity</em>, <em>Evolution of the Word</em>, <em>Speaking Christian</em>, and <em>Convictions</em>.</p>&#x201c;In Putting Away Childish Things, Borg has chosen fiction as the best vehicle for exploring Christianity, important questions of career and vocation, and thorny issues within the church such as fundamentalism and homosexuality.

Here, he has crafted a bold tapestry of Europe and the Middle East in the early sixteenth century, when four legendary rulers towered over the era.<br><br> Francis I of France was the personification of the Renaissance, and a highly influential patron of the arts and education. Henry VIII, who was not expected to inherit the throne but embraced the role with gusto, broke with the Roman Catholic Church and appointed himself head of the Church of England. Charles V was the most powerful industrious man of the time, and was unanimously elected Holy Roman Emperor. Suleiman the Magnificent&#x2015;who stood apart as a Muslim&#x2015;brought the Ottoman Empire to its apogee of political, military, and economic power.<br><br> Against the vibrant background of the Renaissance, these four men collectively shaped the culture, religion, and politics of their respective domains. With remarkable erudition, John Julius Norwich delves into this entertaining and layered history, indelibly depicting four dynamic characters and how their incredible achievements&#x2015;and obsessions with one another&#x2015;changed European history.</p><p><b>John Julius Norwich</b> is the author of many publications, including <i>A History of Venice</i> and <i>Byzantium</i>, as well as the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Absolute Monarchs: A History of the Papacy</i> and most recently, <i>Sicily: An Island at the Crossroads of History</i>.Finally, after nearly a week spent in further frenzied preparation, Henry and Francis came together&#x2015;for the first time in their lives&#x2015;at the Field of the Cloth of Gold.<br><br> It was a magnificent name, and the occasion was more magnificent still, with each of the two protagonists determined to outdo the other in splendor. Henry brought with him a suite of well over five thousand men, together with nearly three thousand horses; another six thousand artisans from both England and Flanders&#x2015;builders, stonemasons, carpenters, glaziers and the rest&#x2015;had been working flat out for months, transforming the castle of Guines and surrounding it with temporary structures so elaborate and fantastical that they seemed to have come straight out of a fairy tale. Francis, we may be sure, kept a close eye on their work; whatever Henry could do, he was determined to do better.</p><h2>Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front</h2><p>On 22 June 1941, the German army invaded the Soviet Union, one hundred fifty divisions advancing on three axes in a surprise attack that overwhelmed and destroyed whatever opposition the Russians were able to muster. The German High Command was under the impression that the Red Army could be destroyed west of the Dnepr River and that there would be no need for conducting operations in cold, snow, and mud. They were wrong.<br><br>In reality, the extreme conditions of the German war in Russia were so brutal that past experiences simply paled before them. Everything in Russia--the land, the weather, the distances, and above all the people--was harder, harsher, more unforgiving, and more deadly than anything the German soldier had ever faced before.<br><br>Based on the recollections of four veteran German commanders of those battles, FIGHTING IN HELL describes in detail what happened when the world's best-publicized "supermen" met the world's most brutal fighting.

Zitkala-&#x160;a (1876&#x2013;1938), also known as Gertrude Simmons Bonnin, was a highly gifted writer, editor, and musician who dedicated her life to achieving justice for Native peoples. Here, Tadeusz Lewandowski offers the first full-scale biography of the woman whose passionate commitment to improving the lives of her people propelled her to the forefront of Progressive-era reform movements.<br><br> Lewandowski draws on a vast array of sources, including previously unpublished letters and diaries, to recount Zitkala-&#x160;a&#x2019;s unique life journey. Her story begins on the Dakota plains, where she was born to a Yankton Sioux mother and a white father. Zitkala-&#x160;a, whose name translates as &#x201c;Red Bird&#x201d; in English, left home at age eight to attend a Quaker boarding school, eventually working as a teacher at Carlisle Indian Industrial School. By her early twenties, she was the toast of East Coast literary society. Her short stories for the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> (1900) are, to this day, the focus of scholarly analysis and debate. In collaboration with William F. Hanson, she wrote the libretto and songs for the innovative <i>Sun Dance Opera </i>(1913).<br><br> And yet, as Lewandowski demonstrates, Zitkala-&#x160;a&#x2019;s successes could not fill the void of her lost cultural heritage, nor dampen her fury toward the Euro-American establishment that had robbed her people of their land. In 1926, she founded the National Council of American Indians with the aim of redressing American Indian grievances.<br><br> Zitkala-&#x160;a&#x2019;s complex identity has made her an intriguing&#x2014;if elusive&#x2014;subject for scholars. In Lewandowski&#x2019;s sensitive interpretation, she emerges as a multifaceted human being whose work entailed constant negotiation. In the end, Lewandowski argues, Zitkala-&#x160;a&#x2019;s achievements distinguish her as a forerunner of the Red Power movement and an important agent of change.<br></p><p><b>Tadeusz Lewandowski</b>, Ph.D., D.Litt., is an American associate professor and head of the Department of American Literature and Culture at the University of Opole, Poland.

Professor Lewandowski has also published <i>Dwight Macdonald on Culture: The Happy Warrior of the Mind, Reconsidered</i>, and <i>Angielski po angielsku</i>, a handbook on interlingual errors for Polish students of English."In this definitive biography, Tadeusz Lewandowski carefully chronicles the challenges that Gertrude Simmons Bonnin (Zitkala-&#x160;a), her Dakota Nation, and many Native Americans endured during her lifetime.&nbsp;<i>Red Bird, Red Power</i>&nbsp;is a must-read for those interested in this remarkable woman and the history of Native and non-Native relations during the first half of the twentieth century."--<b>A.

Detailing the missing, misunderstood, and lesser-known periods of Gertrude Bonnin's life of advocacy and activism, Tadeusz Lewandowski provides an engrossing account of how she and a cohort of Native and non-Native people challenged and worked to change federal Indian policies in the first decades of the twentieth century. This book asks us to heed more fully the efforts of Native activists negotiating a difficult yet pivotal period of Indigenous political formation."--<b>Susan&nbsp;Bernardin</b>,&nbsp;coauthor of&nbsp;<i>Trading Gazes: Euro-American Photographers and Native North Americans, 1880-1940</i><br><br>"<i>Red Bird, Red Power: The Life and Legacy of Zitkala-S&#x30c;a</i>&nbsp;is a detailed examination of the life and legacy of a Yankton Sioux woman born during the height of violent political and social atrocities against Native Americans in the United States from the mid-1870s through the 1940s. Zitkala-S&#x30c;a (Gertrude Simmons Bonnin) is brought to life through her writings in publications and personal letters. ...In addition, [<i>Red Bird, Red Power</i>] carefully and methodically places Zitkala-S&#x30c;a's experiences as a full-fledged leader, activist, advocate, and politician for indigenous rights and justice firmly within the definition of the later-termed Red Power movement.--<i><b>American Indian Culture and Research Journal</b></i><i><b></b></i><i><b></b></i><br><br>"...Lewandowski paints a portrait of a complex woman. ...[He] places Zitkala-&#x160;a's&nbsp;life within an historical context&nbsp;[and]&nbsp;provides an overview of Sioux history,&nbsp;noting events in Zitkala-&#x160;a's early life, such as the Battle of Little Bighorn, the&nbsp;Dawes Severalty Act, and the Wounded Knee massacre, while also situating&nbsp;Zitkala-&#x160;a within the larger framework of U.S. history though discussions of&nbsp;Indian military service during World War One, the impact of the Great Depression,&nbsp;and the establishment of the Indian New Deal. The result is a book&nbsp;that deepens readers' understanding of Zitkala-&#x160;a's life and Indian activism&nbsp;more generally."--<i><b>Reviews in American History</b></i><br><br>"Zitkala-&#x160;a is the most profound and underrated American Indian intellectual of her generation.

Repeated humiliation on America's battlefields banished Hamilton's youthful idealism, leaving him a fervent disciple of enlightened realpolitik and the nation's leading exponent of modern statecraft. After ten years in Europe's diplomatic trenches, Adams's embrace of the politics of Enlightenment became increasingly that of the gadfly of his country.

The famed French diplomat the Marquis de Talleyrand-P�rigord considered "Napoleon, Pitt, and Hamilton" the three greatest political figures of the age. If forced "to choose among the three," the legendary master of <i>real politique</i> "would without hesitation give the first place to Hamilton." This was no empty compliment. Talleyrand was the resident French expert on American affairs and had met most of the leading statesmen of the United States during a two-year stay.1 Hamilton's varied public accomplishments are the stuff of legend. As a revolutionary soldier, he saw action in most of the major engagements of the war, acquitting himself with a gallantry that occasionally bordered on the suicidal. At the ripe old age of twenty, he joined George Washington's staff, where he quickly emerged as the commander in chief's most indispensable aide and most trusted adviser on military and political matters. As a lawyer, Hamilton was the leading member of the New York bar and the nation's foremost theorist of judicial supremacy and review; Supreme Court chief justice John Marshall considered himself a "mere schoolchild" in jurisprudence in comparison. As a legislator,Hamilton was a leading member of the New York Assembly and the Continental Congress. As a delegate to the Annapolis convention of 1786 from New York, Hamilton authored the call for the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention of the following year. In all posts, he was one of the most outspoken advocates of a strong national government. He was the single most important figure in securing the adoption of the Constitution in New York State and, with Washington and Madison, was one of the most critical figures in the national campaign for the new federal frame of government. As secretary of the Treasury in Washington's administration, Hamilton not only headed the most important and largest cabinet office in the executive branch, he also formulated most of the administration's foreign and domestic policies. By Washington's second term he had become the president's de facto prime minister. Hamilton published well over 150 works and essays, including two-thirds of <i>The Federalist Papers</i>, drafted many of the most important state documents of his time (most famously his three <i>Reports on Public Credit</i> and Washington's Farewell Address), and founded the <i>New York Post,</i> the longest-running newspaper in the United States. In a more private capacity, Hamilton was one of the founders of the Bank of New York, the Society for Promoting Useful Manufactures, and the Society for Promoting the Manumission of Slaves, New York's premier abolitionist organization. An impressive resume for any founding father, much less a poor, orphaned bastard from the West Indies. More than any other figure of the American founding, Alexander Hamilton evoked extreme passions. Friends and supporters admired him with a reverence bordering on hero worship. Adversaries loathed him with a hatred that was truly visceral. Thomas Jefferson saw him as a contagion of corruption, whose public career was "a tissue of machinations against the liberty of the country." John Adams dismissed him as "an insolent coxcomb" and the "bastard brat of a Scotch pedlar." Yet even his enemies acknowledged his greatness. "Hamilton is really a colossus," Jefferson confessed, "without numbers, he is an host within himself." Somewhat more begrudging, even Adams noted his remarkable"effervescence." More tellingly, he sought Hamilton's supervision of his son's legal training.2 Animus was no doubt fueled by jealousy, for Hamilton's meteoric success was exacerbated by his remarkable youth. A mere thirty-two years of age when he joined Washington's cabinet, Hamilton nonetheless dominated the administration. But it was more than jealousy that made him such a polarizing figure. His character, both public and private, sparked wildly divergent responses. Moreover, the political forces he represented and the vision of the new nation he pursued were both powerfully alluring and deeply troubling to his fellow Americans. They remain so to this day. "A Singular Character"--The Contradictions of Hamilton The character of Alexander Hamilton was a jumble of contradictions. Witty and earnest, affable and distant, and alternately animated by a tender-hearted concern for the sufferings of the disadvantaged and an aristocratic contempt for the common herd, Hamilton has always been a bit of an enigma. Arguably the most impressive of the founding fathers, Hamilton was also, in the words of one of his biographers, "by far the most psychologically troubled." This is not to say that Hamilton was a villain. Quite the contrary, he was a deeply principled and essentially decent man, one blessed with remarkable talents. Yet even his greatest virtues and most remarkable abilities were complicated by contradictory flaws.3 On the one hand, Hamilton's intellectual abilities were indisputable. The most brilliant political figure of his age, he was endowed with a mind that was quick, agile, and perceptive. Throughout his life Hamilton dazzled those around him with truly prodigious feats of acuity. To cite just one example, without any formal education except a brief stint in a Hebrew school, he crammed several years' worth of college preparation in Greek and Latin into about six months of intensive study, gaining him admission to King's (now Columbia) College in the fall of 1773. Allowed to study at his own accelerated pace, roughly two years later he had, to his own satisfaction at least, completed his higher education. On the other hand, he was capable of incredibly bad judgment. As a memberof the Continental Congress in early 1783, he sought to extract nationalist concessions from his colleagues through the threat of a military coup by the unpaid and disgruntled Continental Army camped at Newburgh, New York. It took an angry and pointed letter from George Washington to remind him that "the Army ... is a dangerous instrument to play with." Most famously, when James Thompson Callender, the most notoriously scurrilous journalistic "hack" of his day, charged the former secretary of the Treasury with financial malfeasance with one James Reynolds during his tenure in office, Hamilton published the complete correspondence with Reynolds in a pamphlet. In so doing, he cleared himself of a totally unsubstantiated charge and convicted himself of having an adulterous relationship with Reynolds's wife. Hamilton's friends were mortified; his foes cackled with glee.4 Just as poor judgment marred his brilliance, his remarkable diligence was shadowed by his frailty. Hamilton was undeniably capable of astounding, almost Herculean feats of industry. In the little more than six months between mid-October 1787 and May 1788, he penned fifty-one of those <i>Federalist</i> papers whose attribution is exclusive and fixed, averaging roughly two essays per week. The comparable number for Madison was fourteen, and a mere five for Jay. Indeed, on more than one occasion Hamilton's feats of industry foiled his political foes. In early 1793 Republican partisans in the House and Senate passed resolutions questioning his management of the Treasury Department. The resolutions were introduced just over a month before Congress was to adjourn, and since the House had previously acknowledged that the thorough accounting necessary to clear Hamilton would entail at least nine months of work, the plan was clearly to have Congress adjourn with an unanswered charge of malfeasance hanging over his head. Much to their amazement and chagrin, Hamilton submitted seven separate reports to Congress in the following three weeks detailing every financial transaction the government had made over the previous two years. The resolutions were resoundingly defeated. Hamilton was vindicated.5 Yet for all his industry, Hamilton was remarkably frail. In an age when men tended to be rather portly, he was strikingly slender, almostgaunt in appearance, with long, spindly legs. Beginning in his youth, he suffered from bouts of rheumatic fever that left him bedridden for weeks at a time. In the autumn of 1777 Washington sent Hamilton on an arduous and delicate mission to extract soldiers from General Horatio Gates, the recently victorious hero of the battle of Saratoga. Gates was part of a cabal within the army and Congress that sought to replace Washington as commander in chief with himself. As such, he was none too eager to send any of his own troops to relieve his rival. Hamilton's dogged persistence ultimately bore fruit--but left the twenty-year-old lieutenant colonel physically spent. In mid-November he collapsed, writing to Washington of his incapacity from "a fever and rheumatic pains throughout my body." This was to be a pattern in Hamilton's career, great exertions followed by physical collapse. Eventual recuperation would then give way to fresh efforts, beginning the cycle anew.6 Hamilton was acutely aware of his own frailty, an awareness his foes took as hypochondria. Jefferson was filled with contempt for Hamilton's "excessive alarm" for his health during an outbreak of yellow fever in Philadelphia in the summer of 1793. A man so "timid in sickness," Jefferson remarked sarcastically, "would be a phenomenon if the courage of which he has the reputation in military occasions were genuine." Jefferson may have been uncharitable in his doubts about Hamilton's "manly" fortitude, but he was not alone.7 Hamilton's emotional makeup was similarly split between light and dark. Friends and acquaintances were struck by his charm, wit, and affability. The Duc de La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt pronounced him one of those rare figures who combine "breadth of mind" with "cheerfulness, excellence of character, and much affability," an assessment that even Jefferson sh...</p><h2>Practical Herbs 2 (Practical Herbs series)</h2><p><i>Practical Herbs 2</i> follows on from Kress's first book and includes comprehensive instructions for making herbal honeys, poultices, and green powders.

Especially not with Zara Mirren, who shares a converted warehouse space with him in Bar Harbor, Maine. While she is a brilliant maker&#x2014;the eyeglasses frames she designs are practically works of art&#x2014;everything else about her drives him bonkers. The way she&#x2019;s always whistling cheesy pop songs off-key. The way her half-drunk cups of coffee litter every available countertop.

The only downside to coming to work is bumping into irritating, far-too-handsome-for-his-own-good Rory Sullivan...even if she secretly enjoys the zingers they throw at each other. On the plus side, thinking up new ways to torment Rory on a daily basis has helped Zara stop dwelling on the fact that her ex-boyfriend cheated on her with her stepsister. But when Zara learns that her ex and her stepsister have just become engaged, she&#x2019;s doubly stunned by Rory&#x2019;s suggestion to go as her pretend boyfriend to their engagement party, in a one-night truce where they&#x2019;ll be a team rather than adversaries.

Alan's father, Merrill, brought Mr. Potato Head and G.I. Joe to consumers and his only brother, Stephen, made Hasbro a Fortune 500 company and Hollywood player.

Because of their ease of distribution, posters in particular have figured as central vehicles of propaganda in nearly every communist nation. In this book, Mary Ginsberg offers the first truly global survey of the history and variety of communist poster art.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Enriched with essays by several experts in a variety of regions, this collection showcases an extraordinary variety of communist art coming from the Soviet Union, China, Mongolia, North Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, and several countries in Eastern Europe. Together they show how effectively posters were used as tools of mobilization, instruction, censure, debate, and manipulation of public thought and opinion. As this collection shows, posters were used not only to promote the authority of the state and its revolutionary ideals, they were also used as a means of revolutionary protest and ways of warning against the dangers of other political regimes, such as Nazism. By their nature, these posters are ephemeral, tied to time, place, and specific events, but many have had far-reaching and long-lasting impact, in no small part due to the astonishing craft and beauty they display. In fact, many of these posters have eventually found their way into museums, due to the strength of their designs.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Beautifully arrayed, the posters in this collection offer a comprehensive look at the broad range of visual works that have both expressed and fueled one of the most powerful political ideas of the modern era.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Mary Ginsberg</b> has had a career ranging from international finance to time as a curator at the British Museum, London.

Over 330 illustrations demonstrate the range and the scope beyond the U.S.S.R. and the P.R.C., with chapters on Korea, Mongolia, Eastern Europe, Vietnam, and Cuba put in context with scholarly essays that cross-reference recurring themes."

McDougall is a gifted storyteller who gets to the heart of the human-animal connection." --John Grogan, author of <i>Marley &amp; Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog</i></b><br><br><b>From the best-selling author of <i>Born to Run</i>, a heartwarming story about training a rescue donkey to run one of the most challenging races in America.</b></b><br><br>When Chris McDougall agreed to take in a donkey from an animal hoarder, he thought it would be no harder than the rest of the adjustments he and his family had made after moving from Philadelphia to the heart of Pennsylvania Amish country. But when he arrived, Sherman was in such bad shape he could barely move, and his hair was coming out in clumps. Chris decided to undertake a radical rehabilitation program designed not only to heal Sherman's body but to heal his mind as well. It turns out the best way to soothe a donkey is to give it a job, and so Chris decided to teach Sherman how to run. He'd heard about burro racing--a unique type of race where humans and donkeys run together in a call-back to mining days--and decided he and Sherman would enter the World Championship in Colorado.<br><br>Easier said than done. In the course of Sherman's training, Chris would have to recruit several other runners, both human and equine, and call upon the wisdom of burro racers, goat farmers, Amish running club members, and a group of irrepressible female long-haul truckers. Along the way, he shows us the life-changing power of animals, nature, and community.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL covered wars in Rwanda and Angola as a foreign correspondent for the Associated Press before writing his best-selling book <i>Born to Run</i>. His fascination with the limits of human potential led him to create the <i>Outside</i> magazine web series, "Art of the Hero." He currently lives with his wife, two daughters, and a farmyard menagerie in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.Chapter 3: No One Likes Us, We Don&#x2019;t Care<br><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, crap!&#x201d; Tanya suddenly realized it was nearly three p.m.<br><br> &#x201c;Late for school.&#x201d;<br><br> She grabbed her shears and gear and moments later her SUV was spitting gravel as Hurricane Tanya disappeared down the drive-way. Every morning and afternoon, Tanya was the driver for local Amish children who lived too far from their one- room schoolhouse to make the trip on foot. After delivering them home, she had a full evening of chores with her own animals, which included three donkeys, two carriage horses, one goat, one pig, a wading pool full of ducklings, and a rescue horse she&#x2019;d saved from slaughter so she could teach a teenage neighbor how to ride. She wouldn&#x2019;t be able to check on Sherman again till morning.<br><br> &#x201c;What do we do now?&#x201d; asked my wife, Mika. We stood at the fence, waiting to see if Sherman would move.<br> Nothing.<br> &#x201c;Either he&#x2019;s getting better, or&#x2014; &#x201d; I glanced around to make sure the kids couldn&#x2019;t hear. &#x201c;Or we&#x2019;re on death watch. Tanya said at this point, it&#x2019;s out of our hands.&#x201d;<br><br> Out of our hands. It gave me a sickening feeling, saying those words, because for one of the few times in my life, it was true. There was no one else to call, no further treatment to try, no friend to seek for advice. That little spark of hope I&#x2019;d felt a minute ago faded away, replaced by the chest- squeezing grip of doom you get when your car spins on ice. Sherman was alone inside this tunnel, and he was either going to walk out the other end on his own or disappear into the darkness.<br><br> I just wished I knew what was going through his mind. If there was no way to pull him back, at least we could ease his exit with kindness and care. But how could we bring him peace when we had no clue what he was thinking? Was he fighting for his life, or giving up? Did he see me as his friend, or as just another tormentor? The first rule of healing is &#x201c;Do no harm,&#x201d; but Sherman was making me realize that I knew so little about animals, I couldn&#x2019;t tell if I was soothing or scaring him.<br><br> Mika and I weren&#x2019;t just surprised to be in this predicament. We still couldn&#x2019;t believe we were in this zip code.<br><br> I grew up just outside of Philadelphia, in the working- class suburbs where the El tracks and row houses of West Philly gave way to the big families and small backyards of Upper Darby. My only contact with country livin&#x2019; came from books; I was so obsessed with My Side of the Mountain that I ran away from home at age nine with only a Wham- O boomerang, fully intending to live in a hollow tree in the woods and hunt with a hawk like Sam Gribley did. Around one o&#x2019;clock in the morning, the state police found me six miles from home in a patch of woods near Springfield Mall and hauled me back for a parental smackdown that was epic enough to put an end to any future walkabouts.<br><br> After that night, I was rarely far from the company of at least 1.5 million neighbors. I went to high school in North Philly and became a street- court rat, spending all my time outside of class roaming the city with my friends in search of pickup games. After college, I bounced around between jobs and cities before taking a leap overseas to see what life was like in Madrid. I taught English for a while and learned enough Spanish to finagle my way into an interview for a news reporting job with the Associated Press. I had no credentials for the job, but the bureau chief in Madrid, Susan Linnee, was a battle- hardened newswoman who scorned the hothouse- flower desk editors that New York headquarters kept sending her and preferred her own method for discovering street- savvy &#x201c;talent in the rough,&#x201d; as she put it.<br><br> &#x201c;The guy before you, what sold me was he looked like the lead singer of the Fine Young Cannibals,&#x201d; Susan told me. Luckily, the Cannibal turned out to be such a natural that within a year, he was recruited to become a war correspondent in Bosnia. Someone had to replace him, pronto, which was the only reason I got through the door for an interview. Susan grilled me for about an hour, and when my utter lack of experience became embarrassingly obvious, she abruptly stood up and called an end to the interview.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard enough,&#x201d; she said, sticking out her hand.<br><br> &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I agreed, more than ready to beat it. &#x201c;If you change&#x2014; &#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll train you here for a week,&#x201d; she continued, already steaming ahead with her plans. &#x201c;Then we really need you there.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;There?&#x201d;<br><br> True, she had mentioned that the Cannibal was her Lisbon correspondent, but I naturally assumed they would transfer someone from Madrid and keep me at base to learn the ropes. I&#x2019;d never been to Portugal in my life and didn&#x2019;t know a word of the language, but that wasn&#x2019;t my biggest problem. Civil war had just re- ignited in Angola, which didn&#x2019;t seem like any of my business until my new boss explained that as a former Portuguese colony, Angola literally became my business at the moment I shook her hand.<br><br> One month later, I was behind rebel lines in southern Africa, doing my best to stay alive while pretending I had any idea what I was doing. I was teamed with Guilherme, a Portuguese photographer who also spoke Spanish, so most of the time the only way I could gather information from Angolan soldiers was by way of a spoken- word Rube Goldberg machine: I&#x2019;d feed my questions in Spanish to Guilherme, who would translate them into Portuguese for the soldiers, and then translate their answers back to me in Spanish so I could jot them down in English. Guilherme had his own work to do and really didn&#x2019;t have time for this nonsense, so he would listen to a soldier&#x2019;s long, teary- eyed saga and boil it down to &#x201c;They shot lots of the bad guys.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Big picture.&#x201d;<br><br> Fine by me; the tighter the quote, the quicker I finished. Every day, I had to scout around, interviewing refugees, aid workers, and frontline fighters, then condense their info into AP news stories that needed to be sent to New York before sunset. Darkness was my deadline, because the only way to transmit from the field was with a satellite telex the size of a wheelie suitcase. You didn&#x2019;t want to be up on a hill looking for a signal with that thing at night; for a roving rebel soldier with an itchy trigger finger, the only thing visible against the dark sky would be the blinking green &#x201c;SHOOT ME!&#x201d; lights on my console. The second I hit Send, I slammed the cover shut and scuttled for safety.<br><br> Like the Cannibal, I managed to stick around long enough to get the hang of it. When massacres erupted in Rwanda two years later, I was assigned to embed with the Tutsi rebel army that was racing across the border to rescue civilians from the murderous militias. We were only a small band of reporters traveling with the Tutsis, and we got smaller by the day. One American correspondent was airlifted out when her photographer was shot through the legs and she had to stop the bleeding with her bare hands. A French radio journalist was stricken by cerebral malaria and barely survived. My photographer left after we entered a schoolhouse and found the bodies of dozens of young children who&#x2019;d been hacked to death with machetes; the next morning, he found his hands were still trembling. When the Tutsis finally chased the murderers into Congo and the fighting died down, I was desperate for a rest. Instead, I couldn&#x2019;t sleep.<br><br> It was time to go home.<br><br> Maybe it was a bad idea to leave Lisbon, ditching a dream job in a beautiful seaside city, but it turned out I wasn&#x2019;t the only one making that mistake. I returned to Philly and quit the AP to scratch out a living as a freelance magazine writer. One afternoon, I was out for a run with Jen, a friend from the AP&#x2019;s Philly bureau, and she told me about a reporter from Hawaii who&#x2019;d rotated in for a one- year stint. Island gal wasn&#x2019;t loving her new home, and Jen didn&#x2019;t have to tell me why: Philly can be cold and bitter, and that&#x2019;s just the people. If you&#x2019;re familiar with our monument to Frank Rizzo, one of the most brutal police chiefs in city history, or the time Santa Claus showed up at an Eagles game and we drilled his jolly old ass with snowballs, or the way Eagles fans and the Eagles themselves sang &#x201c;We&#x2019;re from Philly, f***ing Philly, no one likes us, we don&#x2019;t care&#x201d; after Philadelphia won the Super Bowl in 2018, you know it&#x2019;s not the warmest and fuzziest landing spot for strangers. It couldn&#x2019;t be easy for a homesick Hawaiian, so when Jen told me she was taking African dance classes, I thought I could cheer her up a little with some CDs I&#x2019;d brought back from Angola.<br><br> Jen invited me to a dinner party that weekend. When I arrived, CDs in hand, I scanned the living room, searching for the brooding, heavyset Pacific Islander. I was still looking when a breathtaking woman with a warm, welcoming smile approached, looking like she&#x2019;d just surfaced off a Tahitian island with a handful of pearls. I could barely stutter a greeting because my synapses were jammed by two colliding thoughts:<br><br> 1 You genius, bringing those CDs.<br> 2 Never, ever mention you thought all Hawaiians looked like NFL linemen.<br><br> She told me her name was Mika,* and that&#x2019;s where our conversation ended. I handed over the music and then got as far away from her as I could, spending the rest of the evening in the corner looking at prints with my photography buddy, M&#x2019;poze. I&#x2019;d ruined enough first impressions in my time to grasp that when I surprised Mika with that gift, I&#x2019;d hit my peak. This woman was so far out of my league, anything I said after that would just begin the process of scaring her off. When Mika brought me a plate of food a little later, I gave her a quick thanks over my shoulder and pivoted right back to M&#x2019;poze&#x2019;s photo book. I stayed riveted to that thing for so long, even M&#x2019;poze was getting bored. But if he was cornered, so was I. I was betting the house on the Tao of Steve.<br><br> I&#x2019;d recently seen an indie film that offered the theory that the best way to attract someone is to follow the leads of both Zen Buddhism and those twin pillars of sexy self- command, Steve McQueen and the Six Million Dollar Man, Steve Austin. The Tao of Steve wasn&#x2019;t pickup- artist stuff; it was more like a guide to better living through impulse control, based on the premise that you get what you want only when you stop wanting it. Whenever you meet someone who makes your pulse race, you&#x2019;re supposed to follow three steps:<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be desire-less<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be excellent<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And be gone<br><br> Purely by dumb luck, I&#x2019;d nailed the first two. I&#x2019;d arrived looking like a hero, and if I didn&#x2019;t want to blow it, I had to keep my mouth shut and get out the door while Mika still thought I was kind and chill. So chill, in fact, that when the party was winding down and we saw that an awful winter storm had blown in, I turned Mika down when she offered a bunch of us a ride home in her pickup. (Yes, the exotic journalist was also wheeling around Philly in her Hawaiian surfboard- mobile. Any argument that she was out of my league?) Two other guys happily squeezed into the truck&#x2019;s cab while Mika asked if I was sure.<br><br> &#x201c;Yup, I&#x2019;m good,&#x201d; I said. I trudged off into the freezing rain, hoping I didn&#x2019;t look as much like a dumb- ass as I felt. Sometime during that miserable hike through North Philly, it dawned on me that like all Taos, the Steve version didn&#x2019;t come with an endgame. Exactly how you&#x2019;re supposed to boomerang back from &#x201c;be gone,&#x201d; I had no idea.<br> I got my answer a few days later. Mika got my number from Jen and called to thank me for the CDs. I mentioned some African food shops in West Philly she might like to check out, and soon we began spending time together. Mika was actually African American and Chinese, I learned, or maybe it was Thai? She didn&#x2019;t know for sure, because she&#x2019;d been conceived when her mother had a brief romance in junior college with a foreign exchange student who suddenly vanished before Mika was born. Soon after, Mika&#x2019;s mother married her true love, an Army nurse named Dave, who took his new family with him wherever he was deployed across the country. Mika grew up in one city after another, always feeling like an outsider, never looking like anyone else, until the day they arrived in Hawaii. For the first time, people weren&#x2019;t constantly eyeing her long curls and cappuccino complexion and asking, &#x201c;Where are you from? What are you?&#x201d; Hawaii became her home because it treated her like family.<br> Mika never intended to leave Honolulu, but she decided to spend one year on the mainland while her boyfriend was learning hotel management in Hong Kong. Maybe I was still Tao-ing, but neither the boyfriend nor the ticking departure clock threw me off. Mika and I had a blast together, roaming used bookstores and attempting with tragic results to re- create stewed goat dishes that I remembered from Uganda. I told Mika about my plans to return to Africa to ride the entire continent on a motorcycle, following the fabled Capetown-to-Cairo route, and for the first time I got an inkling that we might have a future when she became genuinely intrigued about the possibility of saddling up behind me for the adventure.<br><br> Instead, we ended up in a farmhouse in West Virginia, discussing marriage. For both of us, it was a left turn we hadn&#x2019;t seen coming, but we could sense we were edging toward a life together and we had to figure out how it could work for real. Did it mean good- bye to Kailua beaches and adios to that Triumph Bonneville roaring into a Serengeti sunset? Mika had already handled the toughest jobs; she&#x2019;d broken up with her boyfriend, who bolted straight for the airport and flew in from Hong Kong to try to talk her out of it, and she&#x2019;d resigned herself to a longer tour of duty in Philly, where most of my freelance work was based. But before we dove in, Mika proposed a final stress test: she suggested we get out of the city and spend a week completely on our own, desert-island style, to see how happy we were without friends or a city to distract us.<br><br> She definitely picked the right spot. After driving four hours from Philly, we were rumbling down a lonely dirt road on the outskirts of Appalachia. We finally arrived at an old farmhouse hidden in the woods, miles from the nearest neighbor. We creaked open the ancient door to find a beautifully preserved gem, with cast- iron woodstoves and a greenhouse converted to a hot tub room. The first few days felt a little strange, with nowhere to go, no one to see, and not even a SEPTA bus rattling the windows to lull us to sleep at night, but by the end of the week, we felt right at home. When I found I could laze in the creek all morning and still file an article back to Philly with the cabin&#x2019;s creaky Internet dial- up, we were asking each other, &#x201c;Why is this vacation? Why isn&#x2019;t this just . . . life?&#x201d;<br><br> I&#x2019;m a pro at tasks that require me to blow off work for no practical reason (ask me sometime how to repair vintage fountain pens), so as soon as we got home, I began hunting for a home that I knew we had no chance of buying. First I checked whether we could ...</p><h2>Taste of Home Cookies, Bars and More: 201 Scrumptious Ideas for Snacks and Desserts (TOH Mini Binder)</h2><p><i>When it comes to cookies, what&#x2019;s your favorite?

And yet, to be perfectly honest, I don&#x2019;t feel much like writing. I know that seems crazy since so much has happened in the last few days&#x2014;like I should be blabbering on for pages and pages. But I guess I&#x2019;m feeling a little bummed right now or maybe just confused. And even that doesn&#x2019;t make sense, because I&#x2019;ve had such an unbelievably awesome time here at Urbana. I mean, I&#x2019;ve heard and seen more about worldwide missions than I&#x2019;d ever imagined possible. And it almost blows your mind to see how many organizations exist! Still, that doesn&#x2019;t exactly explain this weird mix of emotions I&#x2019;m having. To start with, I feel pretty small and insignificant at the moment (and I realize how self-centered that sounds). But it&#x2019;s the truth, and I guess it&#x2019;s because I&#x2019;m just one among thousands of young people who God might be calling to some sort of missions opportunity somewhere around the globe.<br>&nbsp;<br>I know it doesn&#x2019;t make sense. (I should be glad that so many kids really want to serve God.) Maybe I&#x2019;m just tired and ready to go home. Or maybe I&#x2019;m feeling a little slighted that Josh Miller has been so obsessed with the conference that he acts as if I don&#x2019;t even exist. Now how&#x2019;s that for shallow? (On my part, I mean.) Not to mention painfully honest! Okay, I know, I&#x2019;ve made this big commitment not to date, and I&#x2019;m trying really hard to stick to it, but, sheesh, how does it make a girl feel when &nbsp;someone like Josh won&#x2019;t even give her the time of day? Wasn&#x2019;t it just a year ago that Josh (my number-one hottee) was first getting interested in me&#x2014;little Miss Nobody? And look at us now. It&#x2019;s almost funny. And yet...<br>&nbsp;<br>Thankfully, we&#x2019;re about to hit the road! But before I sign off on New Year&#x2019;s Day sounding so gloomy, I must admit I do feel somewhat hopeful too. And I did get the chance to talk with several missions groups who focus on helping the most impoverished children, kind of like the kids at the dump in Mexico. As it turns out (sad as it seems) children who live at garbage dumps aren&#x2019;t all that uncommon (especially in Latin America). And so, I gathered up all these brochures and e-mail addresses and stuff, and I&#x2019;ll be communicating with the missions groups for more information and advice (not to mention praying that God will lead me!). And that all seems pretty worthwhile.<br>&nbsp;<br>And if it wasn&#x2019;t for that, I&#x2019;d probably be feeling pretty discouraged right now. There were times when I actually wondered why I&#x2019;d come to this conference. Because almost every missions person I spoke with kept saying, &#x201c;You need to go to college before you seriously consider going to work in Mexico or anywhere else.&#x201d; One old<br>guy practically read me the riot act; he said it was &#x201c;inexperienced people like me that gave missionaries a bad name,&#x201d; thank you very much! Well, let me tell you, that really made my day.<br>&nbsp;<br>Still, one nice woman suggested I might invest my summer vacation down in Mexico and continue my college studies throughout the rest of the year. That was a little encouraging. But for the most part, I just sat there in the stands, a face in the crowd, looking out upon all these thousands of kids (most of them partway or even finished with college). And the embarrassing truth is I now feel like this teeny, tiny droplet in a great, big ocean. And I wonder what possible difference little old me can have on anything? But then again, I&#x2019;m probably just tired, and I do have a cold that&#x2019;s making me feel kinda down too. So, I suppose it&#x2019;s times like this that I need to remember my<br>verse about trusting God with all my heart.<br>&nbsp;<br>I must admit, I&#x2019;m looking forward to seeing Josh and the other guys during our trip back home. Naturally, they stayed in one of the men&#x2019;s dorms. (I was in the women&#x2019;s.) And like I said Josh mostly ignored me&#x2014;okay, he completely ignored me. But I suppose that was a good thing. It did allow me to focus my attention on missions without being distracted by his great Matt Damon good looks, although I did notice a few other girls looking as well as what appeared to me to be flirting! Okay, okay, I&#x2019;m not jealous. Well, not exactly. I think I&#x2019;m mostly just tired and need to go home. Man, I can&#x2019;t wait to sleep in my own bed!<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Thursday, January 3 (after a grueling trip)</b><br>Sheesh, I thought we&#x2019;d never get home. A nasty snowstorm blew up shortly after we took off, and we had to go painfully slow and be careful. We took turns driving around the clock for two and a half days. Thankfully, Josh had a cell phone so we remained in touch with our families. But everyone got so tired and grumpy that I was afraid we might slide right off the road and get stuck in a snowdrift and end up just like the Donner party! Well, I doubt we actually would&#x2019;ve turned into cannibals, but we might&#x2019;ve killed each other off. Suffice it to say, I am quite glad to see the old homestead again. And it makes me wonder just how serious I really am about going down to Mexico to live. I mean, that&#x2019;s a long ways from home. Something to think about, I guess. But maybe I&#x2019;ll think about it tomorrow...after I&#x2019;ve slept for about, say, nineteen or twenty hours! By the way, I don&#x2019;t think Josh and I exchanged more than a few sentences the entire time. Oh, well, I guess I should be thankful.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Friday, January 4 (back to the norm, whatever that is)</b><br>Even though I was kind of exhausted, it was something of a relief to be back at school today and back around kids my own age, who are just doing ordinary things like complaining about the basketball team&#x2019;s latest losing streak or soggy french fries in the cafeteria. Although, at the same time, it did seem slightly odd that no one here talked about saving the lost or feeding the hungry or getting Bibles to some third world tribe. And I suppose it all seems just a mite shallow in contrast to where I was only a week ago. But naturally I kept these thoughts to myself.<br>&nbsp;<br>At least my best friends Jenny and Beanie seemed really glad to see me. And I think they were actually relieved to hear that I wasn&#x2019;t planning on dropping out of school my senior year and hitchhiking down to Mexico to save the world or something equally absurd. I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if they both thought I was about to go off the<br>deep end and do something totally weird and fanatical.<br>&nbsp;<br>But speaking of weird, here&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s got me scratching my head today. It seems that Beanie has this new &#x201c;romantic interest&#x201d; in her life (Joel Johnson). And this has got me a little concerned. Not so much because I thought she and Zach Streeter would ever get back together or anything, because I know they&#x2019;re only &#x201c;just friends&#x201d; now, and Josh even told me that Zach probably has a girlfriend at college. (Although I don&#x2019;t think Beanie knows this&#x2014;or maybe she does!) But the thing is, it&#x2019;s been only about six months since Beanie promised God she would abstain from sex, and I suppose I sort of thought that meant she wasn&#x2019;t going to date either. And she hasn&#x2019;t. Well, until now, that is. And, of course, it&#x2019;s her life&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s her decision&#x2014;and I have absolutely no right to judge her. But, sheesh, this guy isn&#x2019;t even a Christian. And quite frankly I just don&#x2019;t get it!<br>&nbsp;<br>Jenny told me that Beanie had been talking about Joel a lot last semester (and I&#x2019;m wondering where was I?), and she said she wasn&#x2019;t a bit surprised when they finally went out&#x2014;to a movie on New Year&#x2019;s Eve, as it turns out. But then, how could Jenny understand my concerns about Beanie? I mean, Jenny still thinks it&#x2019;s okay to date&nbsp; and stuff. I&#x2019;m not even sure where she stands on the abstinence issue. And she and Trent Ziegler have been going out since before Christmas, and he&#x2019;s not a Christian either. But it&#x2019;s really none of my business, right? So why should any of it even surprise or bother me?<br>&nbsp;<br>Maybe it&#x2019;s just that I&#x2019;m feeling a little like the odd man out right now. You know that old fifth wheel thing. Or maybe I&#x2019;m just afraid that we&#x2019;re all going to grow apart or that Beanie and Jenny might stop taking God seriously. Already it seems like those two are living in their own little world. I mean, they live together and work together and the fact is, I feel kind of out of it just now. So how can I possibly step in and say that I&#x2019;m all worried about their spiritual conditions without sounding like a total nerd? I mean, it seems like I should be able to tell my two best friends how I feel, but I&#x2019;m not so sure. What if they see me as some kind of religious fanatic? (Am I a fanatic?)<br>&nbsp;<br>Oh, maybe I&#x2019;m just overreacting to what is simply normal high school behavior. To be perfectly honest, I feel pretty confused right now and I&#x2019;m thinking I better just pray about all this stuff and try really hard to keep my big mouth shut before I&#x2019;m really sorry. (Now, wouldn&#x2019;t that be a good exercise in self-control!)<br>&nbsp;<br>DEAR GOD, PLEASE HELP ME NOT TO COME DOWN ON MY FRIENDS (OR ANYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER). AND HELP ME NOT TO LET THEIR CHOICES INFLUENCE MY DECISIONS. I KNOW HOW YOU&#x2019;VE ASKED ME TO LIVE AND I DON&#x2019;T WANT TO COMPROMISE. I WANT TO STAY STRONG FOR YOU.

He provides shattering glimpses of the horror and chaos of the war, as well as profound insights into everyday life in the <i>Wehrmacht.</i><br><br><i>Five Years, Four Fronts</i> chronicles the combat experiences of Grossjohann and his men as they triumphantly roll across Poland, France, and the sunny steppes of the Ukraine, only to ultimately sustain grinding defeats in the endless, freezing plains of the Soviet Union and the grim, dark Vosges Mountains of France. Grossjohann was a soldier&#x2019;s soldier, respected by his men, undaunted by his superiors, and, as can be observed in this raw, brutally honest account, not afraid to call the shots as he saw them.</p><p>The late <b>GEORG GROSSJOHANN</b> enlisted in the Reichswehr from his hometown in East Prussia in 1928 as a soldier bound for twelve years service to the Weimar Republic. His World War II service began as an NCO in the Polish campaign and ended as a regimental commander. In between he earned the Iron Cross and other awards for bravery on the battlefield.Chapter One<br><br>The Polish Campaign: Stukas, Haystacks, and High Ranking Generals Historical Commentary<br><br>September 1939 marked the end of bloodless victories for the Third Reich and the beginning of general war in Europe for the second time in less than twenty-one years. After formally repudiating the military limitations of the Versailles Treaty in March 1935, Hitler supervised the vigorous reconstruction of the German Armed Forces (Wehrmacht), including a new Navy (Kriegsmarine) and Air Force (Luftwaffe), as well as a much larger and partially mechanized Army (Heer). The following four years brought immense territorial gains for Germany, without the loss of a single German soldier&#x2019;s life in combat. Between March 1936 and March 1939, the German Army reoccupied the Rhineland, annexed Austria, seized most of Czechoslovakia, and occupied Lithuanian Memel, all without firing a shot. As a result, when the German Army was called upon to invade Poland in September 1939, it was a hugely reinvigorated but essentially untried organization.<br><br>Given their defensive mission, the Polish Army seemed to have a chance against the Germans. The Germans were committing fourteen mechanized divisions, forty-four infantry and mountain divisions, and a cavalry brigade to the conquest of the twenty-three-year-old Polish state. With a standing establishment of thirty infantry divisions, a cavalry division, and eleven cavalry brigades, the Poles could effectively double that number upon mobilization. Their soldiers were generally well trained and highly motivated. Unfortunately for them, mobilization of their Army only began on 30 August, and the German invasion began on 1 September. Furthermore, a significant number of units had to be deployed in the east in the event of a Soviet invasion, thus diluting what was available to oppose the Germans in the west. With the conclusion of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact on 23 August, the Poles had every reason to suspect trouble from the East.<br><br>To make things worse for the Poles, their Army was supported by a weak and poorly equipped Air Force which counted fewer than four hundred combat aircraft. Overwhelmed by the 1,400 fighters and bombers of the Luftwaffe, the Polish Air Force offered no effective resistance throughout the conflict. Tanks and antitank guns were outdated and few in number and were deployed ineffectively in a dispersed fashion; horse cavalry was utterly anachronistic on a mid-twentieth-century battlefield and nearly useless for anything beyond reconnaissance missions in difficult terrain. With the Polish Air Force out of the picture, the Luftwaffe vigorously supported the ground maneuvers of the Army with, among other types, siren-equipped Stuka dive bombers, which sowed not only destruction but demoralization among the Polish defenders. To make the situation completely untenable, the Polish High Command deployed their forces well forward, with few defensive features between them and the attackers. This posture made defense not only difficult for Polish tactical commanders, but actually facilitated a massive German envelopment of a huge portion of the Polish forces, namely the Poznan Army, in western Poland.<br><br>Basically, the German strategy was to engulf the better part of the Polish Army in a huge double envelopment, with the jaws of the pincers snapping shut on Warsaw. Further fingers would stretch out to seize Lvov in the south and Brest in the north. To this end, the German Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres, or OKH) organized their forces into two Army Groups. Army Group South, under von Rundstedt, consisted of Blaskowitz&#x2019;s Eighth, von Reichenau&#x2019;s Tenth, and List&#x2019;s Fourteenth Armies. Von Rundstedt&#x2019;s troops carried out the main effort, spearheading their assault with ten of the mechanized divisions. Army Group North, under von Bock, consisted of von K�chler&#x2019;s Third and von Kluge&#x2019;s Fourth Armies. Von Bock&#x2019;s units cut the Danzig/Gdansk Corridor, isolating Poland from the sea, and enveloped the Polish Modlin and Pomorze Armies from the north.<br><br>Overall, although intending to take advantage of the superior mobility afforded by armored formations and the flexibility of the &#x201c;aerial artillery&#x201d; that was Luftwaffe air support, the strategic concept and corollary course of the campaign was one more akin to the Schlieffen Plan of the First World War than to later German &#x201c;Blitzkriegs.&#x201d; The material destruction of the Polish Army was the principal objective, rather than concentrating on the elimination of the Poles&#x2019; will to fight. Indeed, although they fought valiantly and stubbornly, the outnumbered and outmaneuvered Polish Army was well on the way to destruction at the hands of the Germans even before the invasion by the Soviet Army from the east on 17 September.<br><br>Although a few Polish horse cavalry units conducted some limited incursions into East Prussian territory, the Germans seized the strategic and operational initiative from the beginning and retained it throughout the campaign. Overall, while German panzer and Luftwaffe components performed well enough in the Polish campaign, it was the German infantry, supported by horse-drawn artillery, who fought and won the lion&#x2019;s share of the battles. The campaign was concluded with stunning brevity, and at a relatively &#x201c;low&#x201d; cost to the attackers&#x2014;a little over 10,000 Germans killed.<br><br>Georg Grossjohann&#x2019;s part in the Polish campaign was somewhat removed from the foci of critical combat actions. On 1 September 1939, von K�chler&#x2019;s Third Army attacked from East Prussia against the Modlin Army and part of Group Narev. The author&#x2019;s unit, the 21st Infantry Division, was one of the eight infantry divisions von K�chler threw against the Poles to this end. As members of the divisional Field Reserve Battalion, Georg and his men followed in the train of the Division&#x2019;s combat echelons. Although the author consequently saw limited action in this campaign, his experiences were nevertheless illustrative of many of the key features of the war in Poland in 1939.<br><br>Georg Grossjohann Remembers . . .<br><br>The German populace was deeply disconcerted by the developments of 1939, as the government probably was also. We soldiers, who knew the true face of war from the stories told us by our fathers, were certainly not enthused about the prospect of an early hero&#x2019;s death. We were, however, prepared to do our bitter duty.<br><br>By the middle of July 1939, all of our units were at the sort of high personnel strength that we had previously only seen during mobilization exercises. Everything went<br><br>along in a smooth and well-organized fashion, like a well-oiled machine. No one spoke of a looming war, and secretly each of us hoped that the whole process would run its course as it all had before.<br><br>In the beginning of August, our 2d Battalion, Infantry Regiment 3 conducted a fortification exercise along the Polish border. We built positions for use in the event of a possible altercation with Poland. It appeared to me that measures were being taken to avoid leaving married soldiers, particularly those with children, in combat positions. As my company was departing our garrison, I was transferred to a newly organized divisional replacement battalion (Field Replacement Battalion 21). The departure from my 9th Company comrades, with whom I had spent many years, was not easy. I attempted to return to my old gang as a replacement during the first days of the war in Poland but was foiled.<br><br>The Field Replacement Battalion was stationed in the East Prussian town of Mohrungen, as was the headquarters of Third Army. I saw that the signs around the barracks simply read &#x201c;Exercise Army&#x2014;3d Command.&#x201d; The Third Army&#x2019;s commanding general was our old commander, General der Artillerie Georg von K�chler. The nucleus of this Army was composed of the three original East Prussian infantry divisions. The Third Army only had eight infantry divisions, the 4th Panzer Bri-gade, and the only horse cavalry brigade in the German Wehrmacht. The Third Army was also one of the smallest field armies to participate in the Polish campaign; the Tenth Army, in comparison, boasted eighteen divisions, including two panzer and two motorized divisions.<br><br>Upon arriving in Morhrungen, I reported to the Stabsfeldwebel of the replacement company to which I had been assigned. He was a nice older man nearing the completion of his twenty-fourth year of service&#x2014;one of the rare &#x201c;twenty-four pointers!&#x201d; He had only made it that far because he had been assigned to the regimental band. Now this old Stabsfeldwebel had been assigned as our first sergeant. Unfortunately, he would later be killed in a pointless attack in the Maginot Line.<br><br>In short order, after assembling in Mohrungen, the Field Replacement Battalion outfitted and equipped the arriving reservists. Immediately thereafter, the battalion was entrained and transported to join the rest of the 21st Infantry Division, already in their assembly areas near the Polish border in the vicinity of Graudenz. As an older NCO, I was henceforth sent back to our East Prussian garrison town, where over a decade ago I had &#x201c;endured&#x201d; my recruit training.<br>Osterode was a town of about 16,000 inhabitants, and our adjacent garrison held about 1,000 soldiers. Despite our modest pay, our presence was always an important factor in the economy of this small city. Except for occasional unseemly incidents&#x2014;and by today&#x2019;s standards, even these incidents were harmless affairs, such as minor fist fights&#x2014;all businesses welcomed soldiers within their walls.<br><br>Businesses which provided diversions or entertainment for the troops during their free time were naturally an important part of the economic community of each garrison town. During my time there from 1928 to 1939, Osterode had two movie theaters, three dance caf�s, a good dozen cozy and friendly taverns, and many excellent guest house/restaurants. There were a great many things for soldiers to do in and around Osterode. Our favorite activities included eating, drinking, dancing, taking part in different sporting activities, or traveling about the beautiful East Prussian countryside by boat or by railroad. Every weekend there were dances held in three large halls in town, although one could also choose to go to a private club, either the type to which one needed a bona fide invitation, or one at which one could pay to enter. Cultural activities were not especially favored by young infantrymen. Of course, the deciding factor regarding our off-duty endeavors was always the same&#x2014;money!<br><br>Five marks was generally enough for an evening. To get into the mood to go to a dance hall, for example, one had to have the means to purchase the necessary potions; a little beer and maybe a shot of rye whiskey were usually enough to dispel any hesitation. The bottle of beer cost twenty-five pfennigs in a tavern; cognac cost twenty, and a shot of clear whiskey was ten pfennigs. Once fortified, we would make our way to the close combat ball.<br><br>Once at the objective&#x2014;a dance hall&#x2014;one had to carefully protect one&#x2019;s remaining resources, as the entry fees were usually about three marks. To remain in the place, one must always have a drink in front of him, so we had to use our soldierly initiative to find ways of staying. There was usually a long bar in the room adjacent to the dance hall, and this is where the poorest among us could be found. Grizzled veterans of the First World War made the best companions here, as they would happily refresh our drinks while regaling us with stories of their heroic deeds at Verdun or on the Somme. A truly virtuoso sponge could extend this act for hours by reacting with expressions of wonderment and astonishment as these old boys spun their tales. In the end, however, it often took equal imagination to pry oneself away from these beneficent old men; usually, conjuring the illusion of bodily needs was the answer!<br><br>It is well known that our East Prussian girls were beautiful, and the population generally also retained a positive attitude about the soldiery. In fact, among most of the girls, military service was a large part of the measure of a man and was expected. Nevertheless, the situation in Osterode was complicated&#x2014;it was not simple for the girls of a town of its size to remain respectable around a population of 1,000 predominately single young men. This was especially so for nice girls, who had to contend with many young men who were less than completely serious in their ultimate intentions. The selection of the right partner required a profound knowledge of the psyche of postpubescent infantrymen. However, it seemed that this knowledge was passed on to the girls of every old garrison town through their mother&#x2019;s milk, as many of their female antecedents had confronted precisely the same challenges for generations before. Further, most girls knew that most troops were not likely to keep their mouths shut once they got back to the barracks, and that they would promptly announce the news of their successes to their barrack mates the next morning. Thus, most young infantrymen didn&#x2019;t stand a chance of satisfying their blooming passions with a nice girl in Osterode.<br><br>This did not mean that the citizens or girls of Osterode had anything against a long-term attachment to a career soldier . . . and we were all career soldiers in the Reichswehr! Indeed, quite the opposite was true. Since most twelve-pointers went on to have respectable careers in civil service, marriage to one of us was generally welcomed by the families of our garrison town.<br><br>Like many East Prussian towns, Osterode lay beside a large lake. In the lower quarter of the city, there was an esplanade which on holidays would be decorated with garlands of lanterns a kilometer long. There was also a pier with docks for small passenger ships, on which one could make excursions. Many of our East Prussian lakes were connected by canals, so travel to many destinations was easy. In the early 1930s, our battalion founded a water sports club, from which one could obtain the use of a canoe or rowboat. In the summer months, these boats were in more or less constant usage during off-duty hours, mostly to chauffeur our girlfriends around to quiet inlets or small rush-covered islands.<br>In the late summer of 1939, however, these idylls were rapidly becoming a thing of the seemingly distant past. It was the last days of August 1939. I had once read that the summer days before the beginning of the First World War were especially beautiful, as if Nature was presenting her greatest splendor just before the dying began. Now, twenty-five years later, one could have written the same thing. Each summer day was more magnificent than the last.<br><br>On the evening of 25 August, our company commander opined that X-Hour was imminent.l Only much later did we find out why the operation was delayed and the units already on the way to their objectives pulled back. Feverish, last-minute diplomatic maneuvers to avert war were taking place. By 31 August, however, von Ribbentrop declared that he no longer had authority to negotiate. The dice had been thrown!<br><br>&#x201c;Situation White&#x201d; went into effect. The order to execute, which had already come down from the highest command authorities in the late afternoon, was brief: &#x201c;Missions and objectives remain the same. X-Day&#x2014; 1 September 1939. X-Hour&#x2014;0445.&#x201d; As I opened the window in my barracks at 0500, I heard an endless peal of thunder from the south. The artillery on the Polish border had opened fire.<br><br>I was dumbstruck. My childhood memories of the First World War were still very distinct. I hurried into the barracks square to find someone with whom to talk. There stood the former commander of our 11th Company, Major von T., now in the uniform of a general staff officer, and the Ia of our division,2 surrounded by ...</p><h2>Russia Without Putin: Money, Power and the Myths of the New Cold War</h2><p><b>How the West's obsession with Vladimir Putin prevents it from understanding Russia</b><br><br>It is impossible to think of Russia today without thinking of Vladimir Putin. More than any other major national leader, he personifies his country in the eyes of the outside world, and dominates Western media coverage of it to an extraordinary extent. In Russia itself, he is likewise the centre of attention for detractors and supporters alike. But as Tony Wood argues, this overwhelming focus on the president and his personality means that we understand Russia less than we ever did before. Too much attention is paid to the man, and not enough to the country outside the Kremlin's walls. <br><br>In this timely and provocative analysis, Wood looks beyond Putin to explore the profound changes Russia has undergone since 1991. In the process, he challenges many of the common assumptions made about contemporary Russia. Though commonly viewed as an ominous return to Soviet authoritarianism, Putin's rule should instead be seen as a direct continuation of Yeltsin's in the 1990s. And though many of Russia's problems today are blamed on legacies of the Soviet past, Wood argues that the core features of Putinism--a predatory, authoritarian elite presiding over a vastly unequal society--are integral to the system set in place after the fall of Communism.<br><br>What kind of country has emerged from Russia's post-Soviet transformations, and where might it go in future? <i>Russia Without Putin</i> culminates in an arresting analysis of the country's foreign policy--identifying the real power dynamics behind its escalating clashes with the West--and with reflections on the paths Russia might take in the 21st century.</p><p><b>Tony Wood</b> lives in New York and writes on Russia and Latin America.

A crucial contribution.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Branko Marcetic,&nbsp;<i>Jacobin</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The title of this excellent book ... seems to echo the slogan that was chanted in Moscow in 2012 by crowds calling for regime change.

Was the series originally supposed to be about Isabel or did you always plan on writing about a family of sleuths?<br><br> <b>A:</b> I first envisioned the Spellmans over seven years ago. And if memory serves me, which it rarely does, the entire cast of characters sort of came to me over a short period of time. The germ of the idea was always to write about a family of private investigators and how the nature of the business affected their family life. I knew that if the parents were spying on their children, they'd need a motivation. That's when Isabel's character took form. I figured a history of rebellion would keep the parental unit constantly on watch.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Isabel has an interesting relationship with her family, to say the least. Do her experiences represent any of your experiences with your parents/siblings? Or are you guys relatively "normal"?<br><br> <b>A:</b> I wouldn't say that my family is normal. I'm not sure how many of those are left. But the Spellmans are pure fiction. They do not in any way represent my family or my familial experience.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Which of your characters do you feel has matured the most over the course of the series? Do you think any of them have regressed?<br><br> <b>A:</b> Isabel has matured the most. She had the furthest to go. The rest of them go through phases of regression, depending on the book. But that has always seemed to me to be normal development. People don't move in straight lines.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Have you ever had any prom night shenanigans like Isabel did? We won't tell anyone, we promise...<br><br> <b>A:</b> There was an incident the night before graduation that I was involved in. So was some toilet paper. I'm afraid I was nowhere near as delinquently creative as Isabel.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> In each book in the <i>Spellman</i> series, you've denounced the myth that stakeouts are fun or exciting. You make them seem like tedious, time-consuming work. Have you ever been on one yourself? Are they as bad as you make them seem?<br><br> <b>A:</b> I was on a few surveillance jobs as part of a big team. I would be the person to follow the subject on foot when the need arose. But most of the time, we were sitting in a car doing nothing. Generally surveillance is a solo activity. How exciting can sitting alone in a car for hours on end be?<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Where did you get the idea to put the footnotes at the bottom of the pages? Was it only meant to happen once or twice and you just started having too much fun?<br><br> <b>A:</b> That's pretty much how it happened. When I was describing Get Smart, it was too easy to add a funny detail about an episode or character. And it required very little effort. I also liked the idea of Isabel adding commentary to what was already essentially her commentary.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> You instruct readers that if they haven't seen <em>Blazing Saddles</em>, <em>High Anxiety</em> and <em>Young Frankenstein</em>, they are to immediately "run, not walk, to your local video store." Are you big fans of these movies? What is your favorite movie and why?<br><br> <b>A:</b> I am a huge Mel Brooks fan. And I do think that not seeing his canon of classics is a bit criminal or clueless. I could never really choose a favorite book, but whenever I'm asked what my favorite movie is I always say <em>Withnail &amp; I</em>, a British film from 1987. It's funny and sad and absolutely gorgeous to look at. It's the film I can watch over and over again.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Throughout the <i>Spellman</i> series, you've also mentioned a number of TV shows that Isabel is a fan of: <em>Get Smart</em>, <em>The Wire</em>, <em>Doctor Who</em>. Are you a big fan of these shows as well? Did you intend to incorporate so many pop culture references into your book or did it just turn out that way?<br><br> <b>A:</b> I love <em>The Wire</em>. I can't think of a television show that I think is superior to it in any way. I was obsessed with it from the moment it came on the air. I do also love <i>Doctor Who</i> and <i>Get Smart</i>. As I've said before, you can learn a lot from a person's choice of entertainment. That's part of the reason for pop-culture references in the books. But it's also because in real life we reference these things all the time. Far more than most books indicate. It just seems to be a fair reflection of reality.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Why did you decide to reignite the romance between Henry and Isabel? Was there ever a different ending to the book where they parted ways? Did you always think they were meant to be together from the moment he was introduced in <i>The Spellman Files</i>?<br><br> <b>A:</b> When I first wrote <i>The Spellman Files</i>, I had no idea that Henry Stone would turn out so interesting. He was a small character in the first book. But I didn't want him to read as flat. So as I tried to flesh out his character, he took on a life of his own, and his various relationships with the Spellmans happened organically. I've written the relationship between Henry and Isabel as I've gone along. There was never a master plan. I just wrote what felt right.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> What's next for you? Are there more Spellman adventures to come?<br><br> <b>A:</b> I just completed my first non-Spellman book, which was very exciting, and now I'm ready to come back to them. So I suspect there will be a return of the Spellmans in the not-too-distant future. </p>Lisa Lutz is the author of the<i> New York Times</i> bestselling, Edgar Award&#x2013; and Macavity Award&#x2013;nominated, and Alex Award&#x2013;winning Spellman Files&nbsp;series, as well as the novels <i>How to Start a Fire</i>, <i>The Passenger</i>, and <i>The Swallows</i>.

A ghost who taught Sarah how to see the auras of the undead tells her Ayaan is still alive, and she sets out with the pilot Osman and some friendly mummies, who want to rescue those of their number the Tzarevich has captured, to rescue Ayaan or, if necessary, to &#34;sanitize&#34; her so she doesn&#39;t return as a zombie.

"When you can feel in your cells that you're coming to the end of your tour of duty," he said, "what is the spiritual work of this time, and how do we prepare for the mystery?"</p><p>Davidson, who has a seeker's heart and a skeptic's mind, jumped at the chance to spend time with him. She'd long feared that death would be a complete annihilation, while Reb Zalman felt certain that "something continues." He said he didn't want to convince her of anything. "What I want is to loosen your mind." Through their talks, he wanted to help people "not freak out about dying," and enable them to have a more heightened and grateful life.</p><p>For two years, they met every week, and this is Davidson's memoir of what they learned and how they changed. Interspersed with their talks are sketches from Reb Zalman's extraordinary life. He barely escaped the Nazis, became an Orthodox rabbi in the US, was married four times and had eleven children, one from a sperm donation to a lesbian rabbi, and formed friendships with leaders of other faiths, such as Thomas Merton and the Dalai Lama. Breaking with the Orthodox, he founded the Jewish Renewal Movement to encourage people to have a direct experience of God.</p><p>During their time together, Davidson was nearly killed by a suicide bomb, and Reb Zalman struggled with a steep decline in health.

Her other books are Beyond Belief: The American Press and the Coming of the Holocaust, 1933-1945, History on Trial: My Day in Court with David Irving and The Eichmann Trial.A forceful analysis of attempts to deny the Nazi Holocaust. Lipstadt (Religion/Emory University; Beyond Belief, 1985--not reviewed) traces the history of Holocaust revisionism and contends that it can no longer be ignored, showing how Holocaust-deniers, once dismissed as a lunatic fringe, have been growing in numbers and influence during the past 20 years. Citing groups like the Institute for Historical Review, publications like The Spotlight, politicians like David Duke, and academicians like Leonard Jeffries, Lipstadt presents numerous examples of attempts to prove that the extermination of six million Jews is a hoax; that only a few thousand Jews died in the camps from disease; that the Allied bombings of German cities were worse than any Nazi offense; and that the ``true victims'' of WW II were the German people. These distortions of recorded history, argues the author, threaten to undermine our Western rationalist tradition and to legitimize the politicization of history. To Lipstadt, the common thread among Holocaust deniers is a ``purely anti-Semitic diatribe'' portraying Jews as victimizers. Self-declared scholars like Arthur R. Butz (whose credentials are in electronics) claim that Jews used the world's sympathy after the war to ``displace'' another people, establish the nation of Israel, and ``steal'' billions in reparations from their German and Western ``cash cows.'' Lipstadt argues vehemently against giving revisionists a forum in the name of free speech or freedom of the press, and she details the efforts of California revisionist Bradley Smith, who pushed a ``Holocaust was a hoax'' campaign in college newspapers throughout the US. Lipstadt contends that ``the responses to Holocaust denial by both students and faculty graphically demonstrate the susceptibility of an educated and privileged segment to the kind of reasoning that creates a hospitable climate for the rewriting of history.'' An important, well-documented study that deserves attention. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Many wonder at the justice (or injustice) of it all, feeling confounded by a God who deems it necessary to send the majority of humanity to burn there forever. Seventy percent of Americans believe in hell, as do ninety-two percent of those who attend church every week. Clearly, it's a hot topic. Baker offers readers a safe space to contemplate tough issues as they rethink traditional views of hell. In her candid and inviting style Baker explores and ultimately refutes many traditional views of hell, presenting instead theologically sound ways of thinking that are more consistent with the image of God as a loving creator who desires to liberate us from sin and evil. This is an excellent selection for general readers, students, pastors, professors, and grief counselors, and will provide clarity for those with questions about hell, God's judgment, and what happens to us when we die. <br></p></p><p><b>Sharon L. Baker </b> is an associate professor of theology and religion and the author of <i>Executing God: Rethinking Everything You've Been Taught about Salvation and the Cross</i>, along with numerous articles on non-violent atonement and hell. <p></p>Fear of hell has been instrumental in gaining converts to Christianity, Baker asserts in this critique of traditional assumptions about a punishing torment awaiting sinners and non-believers after death. Assistant professor and coordinator of the peace studies program at Messiah College, Baker argues for a kinder, gentler image of the afterlife that better comports with the supposed nature and intentions of a gracious and loving God. One result is that the book includes refreshing ways of thinking about how justice might be reconciled with forgiveness. It frequently relies, however, on popular Christian assumptions about God and a nutshell "message of the Bible" that not every reader may agree with. This is odd because Baker discusses biblical texts that challenge reductionist assertions. While the book's conclusions are intriguing and sometimes convincing, Baker's vehicle for pursuing and communicating them through annoying anecdotes and exchanges with three individuals cheapens an otherwise sophisticated argument. This should be a useful book for Christians struggling to reconcile Jesus's sacrifice and a loving God with the place of punishment and the necessity for justice. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Being belowground again was putting him on edge. It reminded him of the Taldinsky coal mine in Siberia, where he had barely survived a cave-in ten years earlier, spending four days buried alive with six other men before rescue workers finally dug them out, all of them raving, half out of their minds with delirium and dehydration. He still had nightmares about it.<br> <br>The smuggling tunnel he was in ran one hundred feet beneath the US-Mexico border between New Mexico and Chihuahua State. It was over three thousand feet long, six feet high, and five feet wide, complete with a concrete floor, incandescent lighting, ventilation ducts, and a drainage system to pump out any gathering groundwater. Of the fifty-five migrant workers pressed into service by the deadly Casta�eda cartel to work belowground for weeks on end, eleven of them had died during the five-month construction, and the rest were murdered upon completion to ensure its secrecy. The passage had been in service for almost fifteen months now, and so far more than one million pounds of marijuana had been smuggled through it into the United States.<br> <br>The tunnel was accessed on the Mexican side of the border from inside an industrial warehouse, but its genius lay in the exit point on the American side: it opened up into the space of an exposed corral where cattle were regularly loaded onto semi&#x2013;tractor trailers for transport to a processing plant sixty miles to the north. On loading days, special trailers with trap doors in their bottoms would park over the tunnel&#x2019;s opening, and the fifty-pound bales of marijuana would be loaded from below into modified forward compartments while the cattle embarked at the rear. After the cattle were off-loaded at the plant some ninety minutes later, the marijuana would be dispersed into waiting employee vehicles.<br> <br>Zakayev had been all too correct about being a marked man in his home country. Upon his release from Guantanamo Bay, he&#x2019;d flown on a direct route to the capital city of Grozny in the Chechen Republic. Chechen officials took him briefly into custody for routine questioning. After his release, he went immediately to his brother&#x2019;s house, where he learned that a black van had been parked across the street the entire night before with the engine running. This confirmed the worst. His next contact was with the Riyad us-Saliheyn Martyrs&#x2019; Brigade, which took him under its protection that same evening. Within a week, he was spirited out of Chechnya to Germany. There he received an intrepid assignment. Three weeks later, he arrived in Mexico posing as a tourist on a German passport obtained in Bad T�lz from a master Chechen forger working as a printer in the state of Bavaria.<br> <br>Zakayev&#x2019;s American attorney had been correct to assert that Zakayev was not involved in the Boston bombings. He had never even heard of the Tsarnaev brothers before their faces were plastered all over the television. However, this did not mean he wasn&#x2019;t part of the jihad, and no one knew this better than the Russian SVR (foreign intelligence service). Six months after the Boston attacks in April 2013, Russian police had snagged Zakayev in Moscow, where he&#x2019;d been in the midst of pulling reconnaissance for a planned attack on the city&#x2019;s subway system.<br> <br>Though the SVR had been unable to produce any actual evidence against him, it knew that he was a member of the RSMB, and so the agency concluded rapidly Zakayev could not have arrived in Moscow with any good intentions. Within forty-eight hours, they had revoked his visa, trumped up an ambiguous story about an alleged relationship with the Tsarnaev brothers, and promptly turned him over to the CIA as a gesture of interservice cooperation. Zakayev&#x2019;s subsequent five-month stint in Guantanamo Bay had not only steeled his resolve to continue with the jihad but also served to switch the focal point of his disdain from the Russian Federation to the United States.<br> <br>Now he was deep below the border between Mexico and the US, only weeks away from striking the single greatest blow against Western democracy the world had ever seen. In sha Allah! God willing! It was a good time to be a Muslim, a proud time, a proud time to be a part of the jihad. Where Osama bin Laden had broken a cricket bat across the shins of the pig Uncle Sam, Zakayev and his RSMB compatriots were poised to bring him right to his knees, and the Western world would never again be the same.<br> <br>The Riyad us-Saliheyn Martyrs&#x2019; Brigade had been established in 1999 by a Chechen terrorist named Shamil Basayev, and though the brigade had briefly faded after his death in 2006, it suddenly reappeared in 2010, carrying out a series of suicide bombings in the Caucasus. By 2013, the RSMB had shifted much of its focus from Russia to the West in order to garner financial support from its Al Qaeda allies.<br> <br>Zakayev was the only Salafi in the tunnel tonight; the only Chechen. There were five Mexican Casta�eda cartel members with him helping to move a seventy-five-pound bomb through the tunnel on a four-wheeled dolly cart. The Casta�edas were blissfully unaware of what type of bomb they were helping to move, assuming that it was a conventional bomb similar to those used in the Boston attacks. They had no idea that it was a stolen Russian RA-115 &#x201c;suitcase&#x201d; nuke with a two-kiloton yield. If they had known this, they would have quickly killed the Chechen and taken the device for themselves, regardless of the money that Zakayev&#x2019;s people had paid them for their help.<br> <br>One of the Casta�edas spoke English. His name was Javier, and he had been working the tunnel since its completion. &#x201c;We are exactly under the border now,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;a little more than halfway across.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Zakayev said pensively, increasingly eager to be out of the dimly lit tomb.<br> <br>Javier&#x2019;s four helpers swore at the dolly as they wrestled to keep it rolling along. The awkward contraption did not have proper rubber wheels, and the large metal casters seemed to lock up every few feet, stymied by the tiny pebbles that fell constantly from the tunnel walls.<br> <br>Javier kicked the corner of the dolly to get it rolling again and grinned at Zakayev. &#x201c;Do you know the other Chechen we took across last week?&#x201d;<br> <br>Zakayev took his eyes from the bomb and stared at Javier in the shadowy light of the tunnel. &#x201c;What other Chechen?&#x201d;<br> <br>The Mexican pointed at Zakayev&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;A blue-eye like you. He arrived with a green case like this one. We had a better cart last week with better wheels, but someone up above took it away.&#x201d; He shrugged. &#x201c;Who knows why? In Mexico, things come up missing all the time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did this other man give a name?&#x201d; Zakayev asked.<br> <br>Javier wiped a bead of sweat from his brow. &#x201c;No, he didn&#x2019;t speak much at all. He was very serious all the time. A man of about fifty.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zakayev knew at once who this other man had to be. &#x201c;Kashkin,&#x201d; he muttered, scratching his groin, where a nagging fungal infection continued to plague him. The fact he had not been informed that Kashkin had already crossed into the US with the other RA-115&#x2014;both weapons purchased from a retired KGB agent&#x2014;did not surprise him. Kashkin was a consummate loner and professional, and now that Zakayev knew he was involved, he realized that this entire mission was probably the old man&#x2019;s brainchild.<br> <br>The tunnel lights dimmed and went out, throwing the passage into pitch blackness for three long seconds before they came back on again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that normal?&#x201d; Zakayev asked, feeling a cold sweat break out across his back.<br> <br>All five Casta�edas stood watching warily up and down the tunnel.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Javier said, whispering orders to his men in Spanish: &#x201c;Armas arriba!&#x201d; &#x201c;Guns up!&#x201d;<br> <br>The four men quickly unshouldered their AK-47s, two of them facing northward, two facing back the way they&#x2019;d come.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Zakayev whispered. &#x201c;Why did the lights go out?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Javier drew a pistol from the holster on his hip and stood chewing the inside of his cheek, his obsidian eyes showing like black glass as he stared ahead up the tunnel. &#x201c;It could be gringos to the north, federales to the south&#x2014;or both&#x2014;or nothing at all. We have to wait and see.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zakayev got to his knees beside the bomb, threw back the tarp, and unlocked the lid on the footlocker-sized green aluminum box, pulling out a trigger mechanism attached to the RA-115 by what looked like an old-fashioned telephone cord. He flipped a switch on the side of the mechanism and depressed the trigger grip with all four fingers, holding it like a pistol against his leg. The green light on the side of the mechanism beeped once and then turned to red.<br> <br>Seeing this, the four men with AK-47s bridled uneasily, jabbering away at Javier in hushed Spanish.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is that?&#x201d; Javier asked, his eyes even more wary.<br> <br>&#x201c;A dead-man switch,&#x201d; Zakayev replied. &#x201c;If I am killed, the bomb will detonate.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Turn it off!&#x201d; Javier ordered at once.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; the Chechen said quietly, locking eyes with the Mexican, his gaze set, ignoring the four AK-47s now trained on him from just a few feet away. &#x201c;I will not be taken alive, and this bomb will not be captured. So for now, it&#x2019;s as you say&#x2014;we have to wait and see. If this is nothing, I will deactivate the switch, and we will continue the operation.&#x201d;<br> <br>But Zakayev knew it was not nothing, and he began to pray silently to Allah, his ears tuned to the gathering silence.</p><h2>Memnoch, the Devil</h2><p>In this terrifying novel from the phenomenally successful Anne Rice, the illustrious vampire Lestat makes a Faustian pact with Devil. Satan has come to New Orleans with an enticing proposition. Under the name Memnoch this lord of darkness takes Lestat on a tour through the boundaries of space and time, offering an alternative and personalised account of the Bible, exploring the events which shaped our world. Their journey comes to an apocalyptic conclusion in hell, from which Lestat returns frail and broken. The experience has shattered his perceptions of the known Universe, but can you ever trust the Devil?</p><p>The fifth volume of Rice's Vampire Chronicles is one of her most controversial books. The tale begins in New York, where Lestat, the coolest of Rice's vampire heroes, is stalking a big-time cocaine dealer and religious-art smuggler--this guy should get it in the neck. Lestat is also growing fascinated with the dealer's lovely daughter, a TV evangelist who's not a fraud. <p> Lestat is also being stalked himself, by some shadowy guy who turns out to be Memnoch, the devil, who spirits him away. From here on, the book might have been called <i>Interview with the Devil (by a Vampire)</i>. It's a rousing story interrupted by a long debate with the devil. Memnoch isn't the devil as ordinarily conceived: he got the boot from God because he objected to God's heartless indifference to human misery. Memnoch takes Lestat to heaven, hell, and throughout history.</p><p> Some readers are appalled by the scene in which Lestat sinks his fangs into the throat of Christ on the cross, but the scene is not a mere shock tactic: Jesus is giving Lestat a bloody taste in order to win him over to God's side, and Rice is dead serious about the battle for his soul. Rice is really doing what she did as a devout young Catholic girl asked to imagine in detail what Christ's suffering felt like--it's just that her imagination ran away with her.</p><p> If you like straight-ahead fanged adventure, you'll likely enjoy the first third; if you like Job-like arguments with God, you'll prefer the Memnoch chapters. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>In Anne Rice's extraordinary novel, the Vampire Lestat--outsides, canny monster, hero-wanderer--is at last offered the chance to be redeemed.<p>He is brought into direct confrontation with both God and the Devil, and into the land of Death.</p><p>We are in New York. The city is blanketed in snow. Through the whiteness Lestat is searching for Dora, the beautiful and charismatic daughter of a drug lord, the woman who arouses Lestat's tenderness as no mortal ever has.</p><p>While torn between his vampire passions and his overwhelming love for Dora, Lestat is confronted by the most dangerous of adversaries he has yet known.</p><p>He is snatched from the world itself by the mysterious Memnoch, who claims to be the Devil. He is invited to be a witness at the Creation. He is taken like the ancient prophets into the heavenly realm and is ushered into Purgatory.</p><p>He must decide if he can believe in the Devil or in God. And finally, he must decide which, if either, he will serve.</p><p>In the first four Vampire Chronicles, Anne Rice summoned up for us worlds that are fantastic and distant, making them as resonant, real, and immediate as our own. In this, her most daring and darkest novel, she takes us, with Lestat, into the mythical world that is most important to us--into the realms of our own theology.</p></p><h2>Emperor Mollusk versus The Sinister Brain</h2><p>Emperor Mollusk.<br><br>Intergalactic Menace. Destroyer of Worlds. Conqueror of Other Worlds. Mad Genius. Ex-Warlord of Earth.<br><br>Not bad for a guy without a spine.<br><br>But what's a villain to do after he's done . . . everything. With no new ambitions, he's happy to pitch in and solve the energy crisis or repel alien invaders should the need arise, but if he had his way, he'd prefer to be left alone to explore the boundaries of dangerous science. Just as a hobby, of course.<br><br>Retirement isn't easy though. If the boredom doesn't get him, there's always the Venusians. Or the Saturnites. Or the Mercurials. Or . . . well, you get the idea. If that wasn't bad enough, there's also the assassins of a legendary death cult and an up-and-coming megalomaniac (as brilliant as he is bodiless) who have marked Emperor for their own nefarious purposes. But Mollusk isn't about to let the Earth slip out of his own tentacles and into the less capable clutches of another. So it's time to dust off the old death ray and come out of retirement. Except this time, he's not out to rule the world. He's out to save it from the peril of THE SINISTER BRAIN!</p><p>A. Lee Martinez was born in El Paso, Texas.

But Leo quickly grew too large and was given to Pakistani authorities, who also found themselves without the resources to help him.

She believes we have to chase heaven while we are still alive and allow God to turn our lukewarm love into a firestorm of faith. <i>Chasing Heaven</i> is the story of how God called to Crystal, what He told her, and how she found a way to get closer to Him again here on earth.<br> <br>Crystal assures us that we don&#x2019;t have to die and go to heaven in order to ignite our faith.

It was filled with cookies. With a plastered-on smile and my heart pounding in my chest, I offered the bag to him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ohhh, chocolate chip,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;My favorite!&#x201d;<br> <br>Then he waved us inside.<br> <br>As I walked through the front door, everything hit me all at once. The strong smell of smoke. The thumping, jarring music. The dollar bills and bottles of liquor on the tables. The men, young and old and in between, eager to spend their money. I swallowed hard.<br> <br>This was no place I should ever have been.<br> <br>I was a wife and a mother and a schoolteacher, and I lived in a small suburban town smack-dab in the middle of the country. Waiting for me back at home were my precious twins, Micah and Willow, not yet six years old. I also had two teenage children, who knew me as the woman who pestered them to clean up their rooms, not a woman who had to be searched for weapons by a bouncer.<br> <br>So how in the world did I end up there?<br> <br>I was there because, through tears of desperation one dark night, I called out to God.<br> <br>&#x201c;Break my heart for what breaks Yours,&#x201d; I cried.<br> <br>And God did.<br> <br><br> <br>My name is Crystal McVea and on December 10, 2009, I died.<br> <br>While I was being treated in a hospital for pancreatitis, I went into respiratory arrest. My heart stopped pumping and I stopped breathing for nine minutes while a team of doctors performed CPR and managed to revive me.<br> <br>And in those nine minutes, I went to the gates of heaven and I stood with God and I was forever changed. The story of those glorious nine minutes, and of the difficult, sinful, mixed-up life that led to them, is a story I told in my first book, Waking Up in Heaven. And since that book came out I&#x2019;ve read thousands and thousands of letters from people who tell me all the ways they relate so deeply to my story. Not just the heaven stuff, but everything that came before it&#x2014;the fears and the doubts and the bad decisions that defined who I was for my first thirty-three years on earth.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve heard from teenagers who are lost, like I was, and single mothers who are struggling, like I did.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve heard from women wrestling with the terrible consequences of abortion, same as I did and still do.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve heard from women bound and broken by child abuse, same as I was for the longest time.<br> <br>And I&#x2019;ve heard from people who want to believe God is real but need more proof&#x2014;just as I did before I went to heaven.<br> <br>And what I want to tell these people&#x2014;what I need to tell them&#x2014;is that what happened to me after I came back from heaven was every bit as life-changing and miraculous as my trip to heaven was.<br> <br>And best of all, it is something that can happen to them. To you.<br> <br>Because ever since December 10, 2009, my life has been profoundly changed. I have been utterly and fundamentally transformed, straight down to the core of who I am. In every conceivable way&#x2014;heart, mind, soul, and spirit&#x2014;I am a brand-new person.<br> <br>By dying, I learned how to live.<br> <br>And now I know that while heaven is real and our true home and the place we all want to go to someday, we are meant to have meaningful lives full of passion and purpose in Christ right here, right now, this very moment.<br> <br>We are meant to chase heaven while we&#x2019;re still here on earth.<br> <br>So how, exactly, do we do that? What does chasing heaven mean?<br> <br><br> <br>For me, it meant going to a dark and dangerous strip club. Actually, not just one strip club. Sixteen strip clubs.<br> <br>In one night.<br> <br>Why?<br> <br>The short answer is that, after I returned from heaven, I felt a great longing to go back&#x2014;to find a way to be close to God again. I could never just return to the life I had, as beautiful as it was and as much as I loved it. I was different, and my life had to become different, too. Somehow, I had to find heaven again.<br> <br>And so I started chasing heaven here on earth.<br> <br>At first, though, I didn&#x2019;t really know what that meant. I didn&#x2019;t know how to change my life. I didn&#x2019;t know how to chase heaven. And so I did what we all do in moments of need&#x2014;I prayed. I asked God to bring me closer to Him and to heaven.<br> <br>&#x201c;Use me, Lord,&#x201d; I prayed. &#x201c;Fill me with Your spirit. Mold my heart for Your will. Father, break my heart for what breaks Yours.&#x201d;<br> <br>And that&#x2019;s just what God did.<br> <br>The story of Chasing Heaven is the story of how God called to me, what He told me, and how I found a way to get closer to Him again.<br> <br>Even if it meant looking for heaven in places that seemed more like hell.<br> <br>The experience of dying and going to heaven taught me so many incredible lessons about earthly joy and faith and love. It taught me that the secret to achieving true grace on earth&#x2014;to finding true peace and happiness&#x2014;is rejecting a passive, lukewarm love for God and replacing it with a powerful, practical, and purposeful faith in His Word and His way. It is turning our faith from a few smoldering embers into a raging fire.<br> <br>It is allowing our faith to be ignited.<br> <br>Because the truth is all of us can have our faith ignited through God. This is a book for anyone who wants to feel the incredible strength and power of God&#x2019;s love in a very practical, purposeful way in their lives right now.<br> <br>The message of this book is also that we don&#x2019;t have to die and go to heaven in order to change our lives and ignite our faith. We don&#x2019;t have to abandon the lives we have or empty our bank accounts or move to another country in order to get closer to God and to heaven. It is about each one of us finding a way, given our own lives and circumstances, to go where God calls us to go.<br> <br><br> <br>Now, it wasn&#x2019;t easy for me to step out of my safe suburban life and into some dark and desperate corners of the world. Some people might even say it was dumb or naive.<br> <br>But after I got back from heaven I heard and heeded a call to go into the darkest places there are, so that God could use me to help spread the light of His love there. &#x201c;And if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed,&#x201d; God says in Isaiah 58:10, &#x201c;then your light will rise in the darkness, and your night will become like the noonday.&#x201d;<br> <br>And when I went into these dark places, I wasn&#x2019;t alone. There was an army of others out there who were already spreading the light of God&#x2019;s love in the places where it is needed most.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t always a huge army&#x2014;sometimes it was just a handful of other moms and wives and women just like me.<br> <br>But it was an army nonetheless, because these people were fierce and fearless warriors for God. These people didn&#x2019;t all die and go to heaven and come back, like me&#x2014;in fact, none of them did. And they don&#x2019;t all spread the light of God&#x2019;s love in the same way&#x2014;some literally go into dark places; others comfort people who live within their own darkness.<br> <br>But what they all have in common is a firestorm of faith.<br> <br>They are all leading purposeful, ignited lives.<br> <br>They are all finding a way to get closer to God here on earth.<br> <br>And it is through them I discovered what it means to truly chase heaven.<br> <br></p><h2>Joy Riding the Universe: Snapshots of the Journey</h2><p>Joy Riding the Universe, Volume One, contains forty-one snapshots.

And while many books have covered the artists who contributed to the music of that era, none have exclusively focused on the vitality and influence of the women who played such a crucial role in this incredibly dynamic and instrumental movement. <br><br> <i>We Were Going to Change the World</i> captures the stories of women who were active in the SoCal punk rock scene during this historic time, adding an important voice to its cultural and musical record. Through exclusive interviews with musicians, journalists, photographers, and fans, Stacy Russo has captured the essence of why these women were drawn to punk rock, what they witnessed, and how their involvement in this empowering scene ended up influencing the rest of their lives. <br><br> From such hugely influential musicians and performers as Exene Cervenka, Alice Bag, Kira, Phranc, Johanna Went, Teresa Covarrubias, and Jennifer Precious Finch, to such highly regarded journalists, DJs, and photographers as Ann Summa, Jenny Lens, Kristine McKenna, Pleasant Gehman, and Stella, to&nbsp; the fans and scenesters who supported the bands and added so much color and energy to the scene, <i>We Were Going to Change the World</i> is an important oral history of the crucial contributions women injected into the Southern California punk rock scene of the 1970s and &#x2019;80s. Empowering, touching, and informative, Stacy Russo&#x2019;s collection of interviews adds a whole new dimension to the literature of both punk rock and women&#x2019;s studies.</p><p><b>Stacy Russo</b> grew up in the 1980s Southern California punk rock scene.

Shaggy trees wore white leaves and moonlight glimmered across a glassy lake. The night was soft and all was slow and snow had hushed the earth into a deep, sound slumber and oh, winter was fast approaching.</p><p>For the town of Whichwood, winter was a welcome distraction; they thrived in the cold and delighted in the ice (the very first snowfall was terribly nice), and they were well equipped with food and festivities to keep toasty throughout the season. <i>Yalda,</i> the biggest celebration, was the winter solstice, and the land of Whichwood was electric with anticipation. Whichwood was a distinctly magical village, and Yalda<i>&#x2014;</i>the town&#x2019;s most important holiday&#x2014;was a very densely magical evening. Yalda was the last night of fall and the longest night of the year; it was a time of gift-giving and tea-drinking and endless feasting&#x2014;and it was a great deal more than that, too. We&#x2019;re a bit pressed for minutes at the moment (something strange is soon to happen and I can&#x2019;t be distracted when it does), so we&#x2019;ll discuss the finer details at a later time. For now, know this: Every new snowfall arrived with a foot of fresh excitement, and with only two days left till winter, the people of Whichwood could scarcely contain their joy.</p><p>With a single notable exception.</p><p>There was only one person in Whichwood who never partook in the town merriment. Only one person who drew closed her curtains and cursed the song and dance of a magical evening. And she was a very strange person indeed.</p><p>Laylee hated the cold.</p><p>At thirteen years old, she&#x2019;d long lost that precious, relentless optimism reserved almost exclusively for young people. She&#x2019;d no sense of whimsy, no interest in decadence, no tolerance for niceties. No, Laylee hated the frost and she hated the fuss and she resented not only this holiday season, but even those who loved it. (To be fair, Laylee resented many things&#x2014;not the least of which was her lot in life&#x2014;but winter was the thing she resented perhaps most of all.)</p><p>Come sleet or snow, she alone was forced to work long hours in the cold, her kneecaps icing over as she dragged dead bodies into a large porcelain tub in her backyard. She&#x2019;d scrub limp necks and broken legs and dirty fingernails until her own fingers froze solid, and then she&#x2019;d hang those dead, dragging limbs up to dry&#x2014;only to later return and break icicles off corpse chins and noses. Laylee had no holidays, no vacations, not even a set schedule. She worked when her customers came calling, which meant very soon she&#x2019;d be worked to the bone. Winter in Whichwood, you see, was a very popular season for dying.</p><p>Tonight, Laylee was found frowning (her expression of choice), irritated (perhaps more than usual), bundled (to the point of asphyxiation), and stubbornly determined to catch a few snowflakes before dinner. Fresh flakes were the thickest and the crispest, and a rare treat if you were quick enough to catch a few.</p><p>If I may: I know it seems a strange idea, eating snowflakes for dinner, but you have to understand&#x2014;Laylee Layla Fenjoon was a very strange girl, and despite (or perhaps because of) the oddness of her occupation, she was in desperate need of a treat. She&#x2019;d had to wash nine very large, thoroughly rotted persons today&#x2014;this was four more than usual&#x2014;and it had been very hard on her. Indeed, she often caught herself dreaming of a life where her family didn&#x2019;t run a laundering business for the deceased.</p><p>Well, I say <i>family</i>, but it was really just Laylee doing all the washing. Maman had died two years prior (a cockroach had fallen in the samovar and Maman, unwittingly, drank the tea; it was all very tragic), but Laylee was not afforded the opportunity to grieve. Most ghosts moved on after a good scrubbing, you see, but Maman&#x2019;s had lingered, floating about the halls and criticizing Laylee&#x2019;s best work even when she was sleeping. Baba, too, was entirely absent, as he&#x2019;d been gone just as long as Maman had been dead. Devastated by the loss of his wife, he&#x2019;d set off on an impulsive journey not two days after Maman died, determined to find Death and give him a firm talking-to about his recent choices.</p><p>Sadly, Death was nowhere to be found.</p><p>Worse, grief had so thoroughly crippled Baba&#x2019;s mind that, despite his two-year absence, thus far he&#x2019;d managed to travel only as far as the city center. In his heartbreak he&#x2019;d lost not only his way, but his good sense, too. Baba&#x2019;s brain had rearranged, and in the madness and chaos of loss, no room remained for his only child. Laylee was collateral damage in a war on grief, and Baba, who had no hope of winning such a war, haplessly succumbed to this opiate of oblivion. Laylee would often pass her disoriented father on her sojourns into town, pat his shoulder in a show of support, and tuck a pomegranate into his pocket.</p><p>More on that later.</p><p>For now, let us focus: It was a cold, lonely night, and Laylee had just collected the last of her dinner when a sudden sound froze her still. Two loud thumps, a branch snap, a dull thud, the unmistakable intake of air and a sudden rush of angry whispers&#x2014;</p><p>No, there was no denying it: There were trespassers here.</p><p>Now, this would have been an alarming revelation for any normal person, but as Laylee was a distinctly abnormal person, she remained unperturbed. She was, however, perplexed. The thing was, no persons <i>ever</i> came here, and heaven help them if they did; stumbling upon a shed of swollen, rotting corpses had never done any person any good. It was for this reason that Laylee and her family lived in relative isolation. They had taken up residence in a small, drafty castle on a little peninsula on the outer edge of town in an informal sort of exile; it was an unkindness Laylee and her family had not earned, but then, no one wanted to live next door to the girl with such an unfortunate occupation.</p><p>In any case, Laylee was entirely unaccustomed to hearing human voices so close to home, and it made her suspicious. Her head high and alert, Laylee stacked her snowflakes into an ornate silver dinnerbox&#x2014;an old family heirloom&#x2014;and tiptoed out of sight.</p><p>Laylee wasn&#x2019;t a child oft bothered by the fuss and furor of fear; no, she dealt with death every day, and so the unknowns that startled most had little effect on a person who could talk to ghosts. (This last bit was a secret, of course&#x2014;Laylee knew better than to tell her townspeople that she could see and speak with the spirits of their loved ones; she had no interest in being asked to do more work than was already stacked in her shed.) So as she trod cautiously back toward the modest castle that was her home, she felt not fear, but a tickle of curiosity, and as the feeling warmed itself inside her heart, she blinked, grateful and surprised to feel a smile spreading across her face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maman was hovering in the entryway as Laylee pulled open the heavy wooden door and, just as the ghost-mother prepared to shout about one new grievance or another, a sudden gust of wind slammed shut the door behind them, causing Laylee to jolt against her will. She closed her eyes and exhaled sharply, her hands still closed around her silver box.</p><p>&#x201c;Where have you been?&#x201d; Maman demanded, zipping around Laylee&#x2019;s ears. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you care at all about my feelings? You know how lonely I get, locked up here all by myself&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>(Right, yes, this was another thing: Maman would haunt their home and nowhere else&#x2014;not because she <i>couldn&#x2019;t</i>, but because she wouldn&#x2019;t. She was a very doting parent.)</p><p>Laylee ignored Maman. Presently, she untied an ancient, floral, excessively fringed scarf from around her head and unbuttoned the toggles of her fur-lined winter cloak, hanging both to dry by the front door. The fur was a gift from a fox who&#x2019;d saved his summer sheddings for her, and tonight Laylee had been especially grateful for the extra warmth.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2014;no one to talk to,&#x201d; Maman was wailing, &#x201c;no one to sympathize with my plight&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Laylee used to be more sympathetic to Maman&#x2019;s plights, but she&#x2019;d learned the hard way that this ghost was but an echo of her real mother. Maman had been a vibrant, interesting woman, but the gauzy iteration flitting past our heroine&#x2019;s head had little personality and even less charm. Ghosts, it turned out, were excessively insecure creatures, offended by every imagined slight; they required constant coddling and found comfort only in their romantic musings on death&#x2014;which, as you might imagine, made them miserable companions.</p><p>Maman had settled into a dramatic soliloquy&#x2014;taking care to describe the monotony of her day in great detail&#x2014;as Laylee took a seat at the kitchen table. She didn&#x2019;t bother lighting a lamp, as there weren&#x2019;t any lamps to be lit. She&#x2019;d been on her own for two years now, fending for herself and footing the bills, but no matter how hard Laylee worked, it was never enough to bring her home back to life. Laylee had one gift: She had a magical talent that enabled her (and those of her -bloodline&#x2014;she&#x2019;d inherited the gene from Baba) to wash and package the dead destined for the Otherwhere, but such heavy work was never meant to be carried out by a single person&#x2014;and certainly not by one so young. Despite her best efforts, Laylee&#x2019;s body was slowly deteriorating; and the longer her small person dealt in the decomposition of life, the weaker she became.</p><p>Laylee didn&#x2019;t have the time to be a vain girl, but if she&#x2019;d ever spent more than a few minutes in front of a mirror she might have blossomed into a fine narcissist. In fact, had her parents been around to encourage her ego, she might well have lost the whole of her mind. It was lucky for Laylee, then, that she had neither mother nor mirror to fill her head with nonsense, for a closer inspection of her reflected self would have revealed a girl of unusual beauty. She was of slim, sturdy build, with long, elegant limbs; but it was her eyes&#x2014;soft and doll-like&#x2014;that set her apart. One look at our young friend was enough to flutter the hearts of those who met her, but it was that second glance that awakened their fear. Let us be clear: Laylee&#x2019;s looks did not inspire admirers. She was not a girl to be trifled with, and her beauty was to her as inconsequential as those who revered it. She was born beautiful, you see; her face was a gift she could not shed.</p><p>At least, not yet.</p><p>The work she did was taking its toll, and she could no longer ignore the changes in her reflection. Though her chestnut locks had once been lustrous and robust, they&#x2019;d now begun to fade: Laylee was going silver from the ends upward, and her eyes&#x2014;which had once been a deep, rich amber&#x2014;had gone a glassy gray. Thus far, only her skin had been spared; even so, her newly flinty eyes against the deep bronze of her skin made her seem moon-like, alien, and perpetually sad. But Laylee had little patience for sadness, and though deep down she felt a great deal of pain, she much preferred to be angry.</p><p>And so she was, for the most part, an irritable, unkind, angry girl, with little pleasantness to distract her from the constant death demanding her attention. Tonight, she swept a defeated glance around the many rooms of her drafty home and promised herself that one day she would do well enough to repair the broken windows, mend the torn draperies, replace the missing torches, and reinvigorate the faded walls.</p><p>Though she worked hard every day, Laylee was seldom paid for the work she did. The magic that ran through her veins made it so she was bound by blood to be a <i>mordeshoor,</i> and when the dead were delivered to her door, she had no choice but to add them to the pile. The people of Whichwood knew this and too often took advantage of her, sometimes paying very little, and sometimes not at all. But one day, she swore, she&#x2019;d breathe light and color back into the dimness that had diminished her life.</p><p>Maman was darting in and out of her daughter&#x2019;s face again, unhappy to be so soundly ignored. Laylee swatted at Maman&#x2019;s insubstantial figure, her face pulled together in dismay. The daughter ducked twice and eventually gave up, carrying her dinner into the sparsely furnished living room and, once newly settled onto the softest part of the threadbare rug, Laylee cracked open the dinnerbox. The room was lit only by moonlight, but the distant orb would have to do. Laylee dropped her chin in one hand, crunched quietly on a snowflake the size of her face, and thought wistfully of the days she used to spend with children her own age. It had been a long time since Laylee had been to school, and she missed it sometimes. But school was a thing of luxury; it was meant for children with working parents and domestic stability&#x2014;and Laylee could no longer pretend to have either.</p><p>She bit into another snowflake.</p><p>The first fresh flakes of the season were made entirely of sugar&#x2014;this was a magic specific to Whichwood&#x2014;and though Laylee knew she should eat something healthier, she simply didn&#x2019;t care. Tonight she wanted to relax. So she ate all five flakes in one sitting and felt very, very good about it.</p><p>Maman, meanwhile, had just concluded her monologue and was now moving on to more pressing issues (the general state of the house, the more specific mess in the kitchen, the dusty hallways, her daughter&#x2019;s damaged hair and callused hands) when Laylee retreated upstairs. This was Maman&#x2019;s daily routine, and Laylee was struggling to be patient about it. She&#x2019;d stopped responding to Maman long ago&#x2014;which helped a bit&#x2014;but it also meant that sometimes several days would pass before Laylee would speak a single word, and the loneliness was beginning to scar. Laylee hadn&#x2019;t always been such a silent child, but the more anger and resentment welled up inside of her, the less she dared to say.</p><p>She was a girl who rarely spoke for fear of spontaneously combusting.</p></p><h2>The Fall Feasts Of Israel</h2><p>Understanding the purpose and traditions of the Jewish feasts will give you a deeper appreciation for your God, your heritage, and the gift of redemption provided by the sacrificial death of Christ. <i>The Fall Feasts of Israel</i> will help you understand three of Israel's most significant festivals: Rosh Hashannah, Yom Kippur, and Sukkot.

At fifty-seven, with more than thirty years of malpractice law under his belt, Arthur is known in the business as being &#x201c;sharp as a tack, with the instinct of a killer whale.&#x201d; Today was the culmination of a multibillion-dollar lawsuit involving a local hospital and several of its staff. It was just before lunchtime, and he was cross-examining the last witness when a most remarkable incident occurred. <br>&#x201c;Were you aware that my client had a previous history of heart disease?&#x201d; Arthur asked the witness. He was pacing the room with a steady, deliberate gait, a style characteristic for him, noted his younger colleague, Tim Simcock, who was watching from gallery. <br>As the witness was about to respond, Arthur spoke again, this time appearing to direct the question to the judge. <br>&#x201c;Were you aware of my client&#x2019;s previous history of heart disease?&#x201d; he asked. <br> <i>What a strange strategy to repeat the question like that?</i> Tim thought. Maybe this is how Arthur does things; perhaps Tim should take notes on Arthur&#x2019;s style. The opposing attorney objected, but the judge motioned to the witness to answer anyway. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t recall,&#x201d; he stated. <br>&#x201c;Did you know about my client&#x2019;s heart disease?&#x201d; Arthur asked again, this time to no one in particular. &#x201c;Were you aware that my client had suffered previously from heart disease?&#x201d; <br>The opposing attorney got on his feet, yelling, &#x201c;Objection&#x2014;asked and answered!&#x201d; but Arthur went on asking the same question several more times. Tim saw that Arthur&#x2019;s gait had sped up. It wasn&#x2019;t unsteady, but he wasn&#x2019;t walking in any particular direction. Could it be that the great Arthur Coates couldn&#x2019;t remember what else he had to ask? Tim stood up to approach the bench and request a sidebar. As he got closer, he saw that beads of sweat were pouring down Arthur&#x2019;s face. The judge was banging his gavel, but Arthur appeared to take no notice. The entire room was watching Arthur, transfixed. There were murmurs. What&#x2019;s happening? Is it a trick? Is Arthur Coates having a breakdown? <br>&#x201c;There is something wrong!&#x201d; Tim shouted. &#x201c;He needs a doctor!&#x201d; <br>A recess was called. As it happens, there <i>was</i> a doctor in the courtroom&#x2014;the one who Arthur had just been questioning. The doctor stepped from the witness box and cautiously made his way over to his former interrogator, who was now crouched in the middle of the courtroom like a vanquished gladiator, his head buried in his hands. <br>&#x201c;Are you OK? Do you need help?&#x201d; In a curious reversal of roles, it was the doctor asking the questions. <br>Arthur shook his head. &#x201c;Do I know you?&#x201d; <br>How bizarre! This was one of the most sought-after minds in his profession, and he couldn&#x2019;t remember a key witness? But not only couldn&#x2019;t Arthur recall any details of the case, he didn&#x2019;t know that he was in court or that the year was 2012. <br>&#x201c;I think he may be having a stroke,&#x201d; concluded the doctor, a gynecologist by training, but familiar enough with basic neurology to know that sudden memory loss was potentially quite serious. &#x201c;Someone call for an ambulance!&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>&#x201c;Who are you again?&#x201d; Arthur asked Tim quizzically as they rode together in the back of the ambulance. <br>Tim sighed. It was the third time Arthur had asked him this question since leaving the courthouse. &#x201c;Tim. We&#x2019;ve worked at the same firm for the past eight years. We golf together. Our wives are in the same book club.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Arthur replied. To Tim, it looked as if his colleague registered what he just said, but a few minutes later, when he asked Arthur if he remembered him, Arthur shrugged. He was apologetic, but really&#x2014;he just didn&#x2019;t remember. <br>This was how Arthur Coates presented to us in the ER. On the surface, Arthur appeared like any other high-powered lawyer: middle-aged, distinguished-looking, with a dark power suit and blood-red tie. He feels great, he said. And yet he had no clue what day of the week or what month it was. He nodded when he&#x2019;s told that he&#x2019;s at a hospital in Boston, but a few minutes later, he no longer remembered this. When he was asked to recall three objects&#x2014;a pencil, a lamp, and a curtain&#x2014;he could repeat them back instantaneously, but a minute later, he could not remember any of them. Interestingly, though, he knew that he was born in 1953 in Omaha, Nebraska. He told us that his childhood best friend was a scrawny kid named Auggie and that his first dog was a yippy tan Yorkshire terrier. <br>The rest of Arthur&#x2019;s history and physical exam was unremarkable. His wife, Amy, arrived and confirmed that Arthur was generally healthy. He&#x2019;d never had anything like this happen before. In fact, he hadn&#x2019;t missed a day of work in his life. He took no medications other than a baby aspirin each morning, and he went to the gym three times a week. He hadn&#x2019;t been traveling to any exotic locations, and nobody around him had been sick. His vital signs were all normal, as was his vision, hearing, speech, and gross motor and sensory function. He had normal reflexes, coordination, balance, and gait. When asked to perform basic addition and subtraction or spell &#x201c;W-O-R-L-D&#x201d; backward, he seemed to have no difficulty whatsoever. <br>Could the great Arthur Coates have had a nervous breakdown? Tim wondered. It had been a stressful few weeks leading up to the trial, and this morning&#x2019;s proceedings had more than their share of tense moments. &#x201c;But this is a guy who&#x2019;s argued dozens of cases like this! It&#x2019;s just not like him to react this way!&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Arthur&#x2019;s behavior may seem bizarre, but he was actually exhibiting classic signs of a disease called &#x201c;transient global ischemia.&#x201d; First described in the 1970s in a case involving a farmer who drove a tractor onto a busy highway because he could not remember who he was or where he was going,1 transient global ischemia is characterized by a sudden loss of recent memory. Patients tend to recall deeply encoded, distant events like childhood memories, but not recent happenings. Other than memory failure, they do not have any other neurological deficits. The cause of this ailment is unknown, though it is more common in males than females, and there is some association with a prior stressful or emotional event. The symptoms are self-resolving, usually completely disappearing within twenty-four hours. <br>Because transient global ischemia is so highly classic and specific, afflicted patients can be sent home to await symptom resolution as long as the caretakers at home are comfortable taking care of them. Twenty years ago, Arthur could have been diagnosed based on his clinical presentation alone. No further workup would have been provided, because it was clear what he had. Today, even though his diagnosis could have been made just by hearing his story, the doctors taking care of Arthur were petrified of him going home to recover on his own. Our discussion in the ER went like this: what if we were missing something bad, something really bad? What if he was having some type of stroke that we hadn&#x2019;t thought of? Some unusual metabolic disease? <br>Never mind that Arthur exhibited none of the signs concerning for this smorgasbord of bad diseases. Yet, the resulting management was predictable: to be &#x201c;on the safe side,&#x201d; Arthur was told he needed to go through the entire battery of tests. So he got a head CT to make sure he didn&#x2019;t have bleeding in his brain. His CT was normal, so an MRI was ordered to look for a more subtle stroke. In the meantime, his blood tests, chest X-ray, and EKG also came back normal and offered no explanation for his symptoms, so the neurologists were called to see Arthur. After several hours of consultation, and with absolutely normal tests, their conclusions were similar to ours: &#x201c;Symptoms are consistent with transient global ischemia,&#x201d; they wrote, &#x201c;but we cannot exclude transient thromboembolic phenomenon or atypical seizure activity.&#x201d; They recommended further studies to &#x201c;rule out&#x201d; these remote possibilities, not acknowledging the difficulty of proving a negative. <br>So Arthur waited in the hospital overnight. By later that evening, he was pretty much back to normal. But there were still more tests to do. Arthur stayed overnight to have brain wave tests to make sure he was not having a seizure (he wasn&#x2019;t) and an ultrasound of his heart to confirm that his heart valves were normal (they were). Finally, late the next evening, he was discharged home, some thirty-six hours after Tim and the ambulance crew brought him in. <br>Why is it that Arthur Coates stayed in the hospital at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars in studies, procedures, and specialists&#x2019; time, when he could have been sent home in the first place? Why did we need blood draws and radiation to conclude that he didn&#x2019;t have diseases that he never showed signs of? Why couldn&#x2019;t doctors have provided the reassurance of both the diagnosis and the expected course of his illness, sparing him and his family many fretful hours worrying about heart attacks and strokes and seizures and whether they would ever have the old Arthur Coates back? <br>We were there&#x2014;we can tell you why. It&#x2019;s because doctors today no longer think that patients can be relied upon to tell the history of their illness. It&#x2019;s because &#x201c;ruling out&#x201d; bad diseases has taken precedence over making a diagnosis. It&#x2019;s because we have elaborate tests available at our fingertips, and both doctors and patients have an unshakable belief in technology. Never mind that the fancy tests add little value, especially when used to exclude diagnoses that weren&#x2019;t likely in the first place.2 Never mind that the procedures may actually impose risk or cause actual harm. <br>Diseases have always existed, but modern technology has not always been available. To explain how far we have come, for better and for worse, we present a brief history of medical diagnosis. We identify four periods, what we term the Four Eras of Diagnosis. As you read, think about the three patients you&#x2019;ve been introduced to: Jerry the mechanic with chest tightness, Denise the housewife with vomiting and diarrhea, and Arthur the lawyer with sudden memory loss. How would the diagnostic process been different in each of the four eras? Would their care have been better then or now? Would yours? <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Let&#x2019;s call the First Era of Diagnosis the &#x201c;Era of Spiritual Healing and Magical Thinking.&#x201d; Records dating back thousands of years have described shamans, faith healers, and their equivalents as healers who provided what would now be called medical care through spiritual means. Virtually every ancient society had one such person or a designated group of people who was said to possess the magical powers to heal&#x2014;and as a prerequisite to that, to diagnose.3 <br>Many of these ancient faith healers had knowledge of local plants and herbs and made liberal use of medicinal concoctions in their practice. Others utilized the power of chants and group prayer. The Peruvian Amazons believed that spirits would teach their shaman, the &#x201c;curandero,&#x201d; a song; the shaman&#x2019;s job was to learn the song in order to figure out the specific illness.4 In other cultures, the key to diagnosis lay in the identification of the appropriate evil spirit, and the faith healer&#x2019;s job was to possess the body of the ill and chase out the spirit causing harm. In the Hmong culture, the healer, called the &#x201c;Shi Yi,&#x201d; was said to restore health by calling the soul of the sick from travels with bad spirits and back into the human body.5 <br>This form of healing, grounded in belief of spirits and magic, seems worlds apart from medicine as we know it today. But there is something of this First Era that we still find in modern medicine: the notion of implicit trust. Then, as now, those who are sick entrust their health and well-being to a designated healer. In ancient times, illness was a literal black box: you tell your healer your problems, the healer shakes a black box, and out comes a solution of some kind. As a faithful member of the community, you trust your healer and accept the outcome. <br>Why do we even mention this era when we can take it at face value that few of us would prefer to live back in the land of shamans and black boxes? We discuss it because this era is not entirely in the past. Alternative healing methods are actively practiced today. Many societies continue to rely on shamans and faith healers. In the United States, 74 percent of patients report that they use complementary and alternative therapies in addition to Western medicine, including herbs and &#x201c;new age&#x201d; medicine techniques such as <i>qi gong</i> spiritual healing and <i>reiki</i> energy healing.6 <br>It&#x2019;s interesting to note that these alternative healing modalities continue to emphasize the patient first and foremost. Making a diagnosis requires attention to the individual and his stories. In addition, because healers are typically from the same community as their patients, cultural context is necessarily taken into account as part of the diagnostic process. In all cases, a diagnosis (whether correct or not) is given, with treatment tailored to fix the problem identified. Perhaps as a result, these forms of treatment result in total commitment from the patient and their families, and adherence to the treatment regimen tends to be very high. <br>With the dawn of recorded history came the Second Era of Diagnosis, which we call the &#x201c;Era of Early Empiricism and Disease Classification.&#x201d; As far back as 2000 B.C., the Egyptian scholar Imhotep wrote the medical textbook known as the <i>Edwin Smith Papyrus</i>.7 This is the first known text in the ancient world to describe in detail a method of diagnosis whereby each disease has corresponding symptoms and physical findings.8 A subsequent Babylonian text, <i>The Diagnostic Handbook,</i> introduced the role of empiricism and logic in diagnosis, focusing on rules for predicting when and how a constellation of symptoms and signs represented a particular disease state.9 <br>The Father of Western Medicine, Hippocrates, was the preeminent physician of his time, and his works epitomize the diagnostic approach in this Second Era. Hippocrates was deeply invested in describing the natural history of illnesses&#x2014;how symptoms came together and how they progressed over time. For example, he was one of the first to describe epilepsy as a syndrome of uncontrolled, recurrent seizures. It was not known what caused it or how to prevent the seizures from recurring (many contemporaries continued to believe that they were a form of &#x201c;possession&#x201d; by evil spirits), but Hippocrates noted that lying the patient flat on the ground was beneficial (at the very least, to prevent the patients from further injuring himself or others). Hippocrates also recognized the syndrome of persistent cough, fever, and wasting as pneumonia, which he described as a contagious disease because family members and close contacts appeared to contract it. Unfortunately, this was often a fatal diagnosis, as there was no cure at the time. <br>Though Hippocrates&#x2019;s focus was on disease description and not on diagnosis per se,10 his detailed writings allowed for progress. Patterns of symptoms formed the basis of disease classification, and pattern recognition became the basis of diagnosis and medical reasoning. In Hippocrates&#x2019;s time, few other diagnostic tools existed; moreover, the ancient Greek taboo against dissection meant that little was known about the anatomical basis of disease. Under the tutelage of a master physician, students would learn to recognize common illnesses by learning about and then observing patterns of signs and symptoms. Over time, new diseases would be described and their natural historie...</p><h2>Haunting Experiences: Ghosts in Contemporary Folklore</h2><p><p>Ghosts and other supernatural phenomena are widely represented throughout modern culture. They can be found in any number of entertainment, commercial, and other contexts, but popular media or commodified representations of ghosts can be quite different from the beliefs people hold about them, based on tradition or direct experience. Personal belief and cultural tradition on the one hand, and popular and commercial representation on the other, nevertheless continually feed each other. They frequently share space in how people think about the supernatural.<br> <br> In <i>Haunting Experiences,</i> three well-known folklorists seek to broaden the discussion of ghost lore by examining it from a variety of angles in various modern contexts. Diane E. Goldstein, Sylvia Ann Grider, and Jeannie Banks Thomas take ghosts seriously, as they draw on contemporary scholarship that emphasizes both the basis of belief in experience (rather than mere fantasy) and the usefulness of ghost stories. They look closely at the narrative role of such lore in matters such as socialization and gender. And they unravel the complex mix of mass media, commodification, and popular culture that today puts old spirits into new contexts.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Metaphysical Foundations of Logic (Studies in Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy)</h2><p><p>Offering a full-scale study of the theory of reality hidden beneath modern logic, The Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, a lecture course given in 1928, illuminates the transitional phase in Heidegger's thought from the existential analysis of Being and Time to the overcoming of metaphysics in his later philosophy. In a searching exposition of the metaphysical problems underpinning Leibniz's theory of logical judgment, Heidegger establishes that a given theory of logic is rooted in a certain conception of Being. He explores the significance of Western logic as a system-building technical tool and as a cultural phenomenon that is centuries old.</p></p><p>In a searching exposition of the metaphysical problems underpinning Leibniz&#39;s theory of logical judgment, Heidegger establishes that a given theory of logic is rooted in a certain conception of Being.

Among his most recent are Full Dark, No Stars Under the Dome, Just After Sunset, Duma Key, Lisey&#39;s Story, Cell, and the concluding novels in the Dark Tower saga: Wolves of the Calla, Song of Susannah, and The Dark Tower. His acclaimed nonfiction book, On Writing, is also a bestseller. He was the recipient of the 2003 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, and in 2007, he received the Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America. He lives in Maine with his wife, novelist Tabitha King.<i>Excerpted from Chapter One<br></i><br>Jack Torrance thought: Officious little prick. <br><br>Ullman stood five-five, and when he moved, it was with the prissy speed that seems to be the exclusive domain of all small plump men. The part in his hair was exact, and his dark suit was sober but comforting. I am a man you can bring your problems to, that suit said to the paying customer. To the hired help it spoke more curtly: This had better be good, you. There was a red carnation in the lapel, perhaps so that no one on the street would<br>mistake Stuart Ullman for the local undertaker. <br><br>As he listened to Ullman speak, Jack admitted to himself that he probably could not have liked any man on that side of the desk&#x2014;under the circumstances. <br><br>Ullman had asked a question he hadn&#x2019;t caught. That was bad; Ullman was the type of man who would file such lapses away in a mental Rolodex for later consideration. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I asked if your wife fully understood what you would be taking on here. And there&#x2019;s your son, of course.&#x201d; He glanced down at the application in front of him. &#x201c;Daniel. Your wife isn&#x2019;t a bit intimidated by the idea?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wendy is an extraordinary woman.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;And your son is also extraordinary?&#x201d; <br><br>Jack smiled, a big wide PR smile. &#x201c;We like to think so, I suppose. He&#x2019;s quite self-reliant for a five-year-old.&#x201d; <br><br>No returning smile from Ullman. He slipped Jack&#x2019;s application back into a file. The file went into a drawer. The desk top was now completely bare except for a blotter, a telephone, a Tensor lamp, and an in/out basket. Both sides of the in/out were empty, too.<br><br>Ullman stood up and went to the file cabinet in the corner. &#x201c;Step around the desk, if you will, Mr. Torrance. We&#x2019;ll look at the hotel floor plans.&#x201d;<br><br>He brought back five large sheets and set them down on the glossy walnut plane of the desk. Jack stood by his shoulder, very much aware of the scent of Ullman&#x2019;s cologne. All my men wear English Leather or they wear nothing at all came into his mind for no reason at all, and he had to clamp his tongue between his teeth to keep in a bray of laughter. Beyond the wall, faintly, came the sounds of the Overlook Hotel&#x2019;s kitchen, gearing down from lunch.<br><br>&#x201c;Top floor,&#x201d; Ullman said briskly. &#x201c;The attic. Absolutely nothing up there now but bric-a-brac. The Overlook has changed hands several times since World War II and it seems that each successive manager has put everything they don&#x2019;t want up in the attic. I want rattraps and poison bait sowed around in it. Some of the third-floor chambermaids say they have heard rustling noises. I don&#x2019;t believe it, not for a moment, but there mustn&#x2019;t even be that one-in-a-hundred chance that a single rat inhabits the Overlook Hotel.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack, who suspected that every hotel in the world had a rat or two, held his tongue.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course you wouldn&#x2019;t allow your son up in the attic under any circumstances.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Jack said, and flashed the big PR smile again. Humiliating situation. Did this officious little prick actually think he would allow his son to goof around in a rattrap attic full of junk furniture and God knew what else?<br><br>Ullman whisked away the attic floor plan and put it on the bottom of the pile.<br><br>&#x201c;The Overlook has one hundred and ten guest quarters,&#x201d; he said in a scholarly voice. &#x201c;Thirty of them, all suites, are here on the third floor. Ten in the west wing (including the Presidential Suite), ten in the center, ten more in the east wing. All of them command magnificent views.&#x201d;<br><br>Could you at least spare the salestalk?<br><br>But he kept quiet. He needed the job.<br><br>Ullman put the third floor on the bottom of the pile and they studied the second floor.<br>&#x201c;Forty rooms,&#x201d; Ullman said, &#x201c;thirty doubles and ten singles. And on the first floor, twenty of each. Plus three linen closets on each floor, and a storeroom which is at the extreme east end of the hotel on the second floor and the extreme west end on the first. Questions?&#x201d;<br><br>Jack shook his head. Ullman whisked the second and first floors away.<br><br>&#x201c;Now. Lobby level. Here in the center is the registration desk. Behind it are the offices. The lobby runs for eighty feet in either direction from the desk. Over here in the west wing is the Overlook Dining Room and the Colorado Lounge. The banquet and ballroom facility is in the east wing. Questions?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only about the basement,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;For the winter caretaker, that&#x2019;s the most important level of all. Where the action is, so to speak.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Watson will show you all that. The basement floor plan is on the boiler room wall.&#x201d; He frowned impressively, perhaps to show that as manager, he did not concern himself with such mundane aspects of the Overlook&#x2019;s operation as the boiler and the plumbing. &#x201c;Might not be a bad idea to put some traps down there too. Just a minute...&#x201d;<br><br>He scrawled a note on a pad he took from his inner coat pocket (each sheet bore the legend From the Desk of Stuart Ullman in bold black script), tore it off, and dropped it into the out basket. It sat there looking lonesome. The pad disappeared back into Ullman&#x2019;s jacket pocket like the conclusion of a magician&#x2019;s trick. Now you see it, Jacky-boy, now you don&#x2019;t. This guy is a real heavyweight.<br><br>They had resumed their original positions, Ullman behind the desk and Jack in front of it, interviewer and interviewee, supplicant and reluctant patron. Ullman folded his neat little hands on the desk blotter and looked directly at Jack, a small, balding man in a banker&#x2019;s suit and a quiet gray tie. The flower in his lapel was balanced off by a small lapel pin on the other side. It read simply STAFF&nbsp; in small gold letters.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be perfectly frank with you, Mr. Torrance. Albert Shockley is a powerful man with a large interest in the Overlook, which showed a profit this season for the first time in its history. Mr. Shockley also sits on the Board of Directors, but he is not a hotel man and he would be the first to admit this. But he has made his wishes in this caretaking matter quite obvious. He wants you hired. I will do so. But if I had been given a free hand in this matter, I would not have taken you on.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack&#x2019;s hands were clenched tightly in his lap, working against each other, sweating. Officious little prick, officious little prick, officious&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe you care much for me, Mr. Torrance. I don&#x2019;t care. Certainly your feelings toward me play no part in my own belief that you are not right for the job. During the season that runs from May fifteenth to September thirtieth, the Overlook employs one hun- dred and ten people full-time; one for every room in the hotel, you might say. I don&#x2019;t think many of them like me and I suspect that some of them think I&#x2019;m a bit of a bastard. They would be correct in their judgment of my character. I have to be a bit of a bastard to run this hotel in the manner it deserves.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked at Jack for comment, and Jack flashed the PR smile again, large and insultingly toothy.<br><br>Ullman said: &#x201c;The Overlook was built in the years 1907 to 1909. The closest town is Sidewinder, forty miles east of here over roads that are closed from sometime in late October or November until sometime in April. A man named Robert Townley Watson built it, the grandfather of our present maintenance man. Vanderbilts have stayed here, and Rockefellers, and Astors, and Du Ponts. Four Presidents have stayed in the Presidential Suite. Wilson, Harding, Roosevelt, and Nixon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be too proud of Harding and Nixon,&#x201d; Jack murmured.<br><br>Ullman frowned but went on regardless. &#x201c;It proved too much for Mr. Watson, and he sold the hotel in 1915. It was sold again in 1922, in 1929, in 1936. It stood vacant until the end of World War II, when it was purchased and completely renovated by Horace Derwent, millionaire inventor, pilot, film producer, and entrepreneur.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know the name,&#x201d; Jack said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Everything he touched seemed to turn to gold... except the Overlook. He funneled over a million dollars into it before the first postwar guest ever stepped through its doors, turning a decrepit relic into a show- place. It was Derwent who added the roque court I saw you admiring when you arrived.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Roque? &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A British forebear of our croquet, Mr. Torrance. Croquet is bastardized roque. According to legend, Derwent learned the game from his social secretary and fell completely in love with it. Ours may be the finest roque court in America.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t doubt it,&#x201d; Jack said gravely. A roque court, a topiary full of hedge animals out front, what next? A life-sized Uncle Wiggily game behind the equipment shed? He was getting very tired of Mr. Stuart Ullman, but he could see that Ullman wasn&#x2019;t done. Ullman was going to have his say, every last word of it. <br><br>&#x201c;When he had lost three million, Derwent sold it to a group of California investors. Their experience with the Overlook was equally bad. Just not hotel people.<br><br>&#x201c;In 1970, Mr. Shockley and a group of his associates bought the hotel and turned its management over to me. We have also run in the red for several years, but I&#x2019;m happy to say that the trust of the present owners in me has never wavered. Last year we broke even. And this year the Overlook&#x2019;s accounts were written in black ink for the first time in almost seven decades.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack supposed that this fussy little man&#x2019;s pride was justified, and then his original dislike washed over him again in a wave.<br><br>He said: &#x201c;I see no connection between the Overlook&#x2019;s admittedly colorful history and your feeling that I&#x2019;m wrong for the post, Mr. Ullman.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One reason that the Overlook has lost so much money lies in the depreciation that occurs each winter. It shortens the profit margin a great deal more than you might believe, Mr. Torrance. The winters are fantastically cruel. In order to cope with the problem, I&#x2019;ve installed a full-time winter caretaker to run the boiler and to heat different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis. To repair breakage as it occurs and to do repairs, so the elements can&#x2019;t get a foothold. To be constantly alert to any and every contingency. During our first winter I hired a family instead of a single man. There was a tragedy. A horrible tragedy.&#x201d;<br><br>Ullman looked at Jack coolly and appraisingly.<br><br>&#x201c;I made a mistake. I admit it freely. The man was a drunk.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack felt a slow, hot grin&#x2014;the total antithesis of the toothy PR grin&#x2014;stretch across his mouth. &#x201c;Is that it? I&#x2019;m surprised Al didn&#x2019;t tell you. I&#x2019;ve retired.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Mr. Shockley told me you no longer drink. He also told me about your last job... your last position of trust, shall we say? You were teaching English in a Vermont prep school. You lost your temper, I don&#x2019;t believe I need to be any more specific than that. But I do happen to believe that Grady&#x2019;s case has a bearing, and that is why I have brought the matter of your... uh, previous history into the conversation. During the winter of 1970&#x2013;71, after we had refurbished the Overlook but before our first season, I hired this... this unfortunate named Delbert Grady. He moved into the quarters you and your wife and son will be sharing. He had a wife and two daughters. I had reservations, the main ones being the harshness of the winter season and the fact that the Gradys would be cut off from the outside world for five to six months.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s not really true, is it? There are telephones here, and probably a citizen&#x2019;s band radio as well. And the Rocky Mountain National Park is within helicopter range and surely a piece of ground that big must have a chopper or two.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t know about that,&#x201d; Ullman said. &#x201c;The hotel does have a two-way radio that Mr. Watson will show you, along with a list of the correct frequencies to broadcast on if you need help. The telephone lines between here and Sidewinder are still aboveground, and they go down almost every winter at some point or other and are apt to stay down for three weeks to a month and a half. There is a snowmobile in the equipment shed also.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then the place really isn&#x2019;t cut off.&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Ullman looked pained. &#x201c;Suppose your son or your wife tripped on the stairs and fractured his or her skull, Mr. Torrance. Would you think the place was cut off then?&#x201d;<br><br>Jack saw the point. A snowmobile running at top speed could get you down to Sidewinder in an hour and a half... maybe. A helicopter from the Parks Rescue Service could get up here in three hours... under optimum conditions. In a blizzard it would never even be able to lift off and you couldn&#x2019;t hope to run a snowmobile at top speed, even if you dared take a seriously injured person out into temperatures that might be twenty-five below&#x2014;or forty-five below, if you added in the wind chill factor.<br><br>&#x201c;In the case of Grady,&#x201d; Ullman said, &#x201c;I reasoned much as Mr. Shockley seems to have done in your case. Solitude can be damaging in itself. Better for the man to have his family with him. If there was trouble, I thought, the odds were very high that it would be something less urgent than a fractured skull or an accident with one of the power tools or some sort of convulsion. A serious case of the flu, pneumonia, a broken arm, even appendicitis. Any of those things would have left enough time.<br><br>&#x201c;I suspect that what happened came as a result of too much cheap whiskey, of which Grady had laid in a generous supply, unbeknownst to me, and a curious condition which the old-timers call cabin fever. Do you know the term?&#x201d; Ullman offered a patronizing little smile, ready to explain as soon as Jack admitted his ignorance, and Jack was happy to respond quickly and crisply.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a slang term for the claustrophobic reaction that can occur when people are shut in together over long periods of time. The feeling of claustrophobia is externalized as dislike for the people you happen to be shut in with. In extreme cases it can result in hallucinations and violence&#x2014;murder has been done over such minor things as a burned meal or an argument about whose turn it is to do the dishes.&#x201d;<br><br>Ullman looked rather nonplussed, which did Jack a world of good. He decided to press a little further, but silently promised Wendy he would stay cool.<br><br>&#x201c;I suspect you did make a mistake at that.

With little help from Washington, D.C., Major Robert Anderson, a soldier whose experience had taught him above all that war is the poorest form of policy, almost single-handedly forestalled the beginning of the war until he finally had no choice but to fight. <br> <br>Skillfully re-created from a decade of extensive research, <i>Allegiance </i>exposes the passions that led to the fighting, the sober reflections of the man who restrained its outbreak, and the individuals on both sides who changed American history forever.<br></p><p>Published by Harcourt, 2001, 0-15-100641-5 <br>David Detzer is professor emeritus of history with Connecticut State University.

But "John Reid" didn't write it. Years would pass before the writer could reveal his true identity as Andrew Tobias, America's bestselling financial guru, author of The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need. Now, twenty-five years later, Tobias, proud to use his real name, brings his remarkable life story up to date.<br><br>Writing with his customary charm and frank humor, Tobias tells of love affairs and heartbreak, hot New York parties and tough political battles, the excitement of genuine social change and the tragedy of seeing dear friends die young. Here too are the unforgettable scenes of Tobias revealing his sexual orientation not only to his parents but to the president of the United States.<br><br>The author is an irresistible companion as he shares with us his proud stories, embarrassing confessions, and hilarious musings on "the homosexual lifestyle." Witty, heartfelt, and wonderfully affirming in every sense, this is Andrew Tobias's finest book to date.</p><p>In 1973 Andrew Tobias published <i>The Best Little Boy in the World</i> under the pseudonym John Reid in order to avoid telling people (including his parents) that he was gay. Since then, he's gone on to become a bestselling finance writer (<i>The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need</i>) and columnist for <i>Worth</i> magazine. "Much of my life," writes Tobias, "the context of this book notwithstanding, has had little to do with being gay...." This may seem like an odd statement to find in the sequel to one of the major gay memoirs of the late 20th century. Yet it's also perhaps the point: as Tobias has "grown up" and fully accepted his sexuality, it has become so natural to him that were it not for other people's attitudes there would be almost no reason to call attention to it.<p> In this memoir, Tobias avoids discussing his sexuality in detail, and apologizes for even the occasional indirect remarks he makes to get around talking about sex. Instead, he covers his emotional relationships and the significant advances for gays and lesbians in American society that he has both witnessed and experienced since 1973. He writes in a charming, conversational style, frequently following digressions and then forcing himself back on track. Tobias is lavish in his praise of those he admires, including Bill and Hillary Clinton (who have "done more than anyone in the history of the world for gay and lesbian people"), and tries to see the good in those with whom he profoundly disagrees. <i>The Best Little Boy in the World Grows Up</i> is a thoughtful, self-assured memoir that shows that one way to start making the world a better place is to become at peace with oneself. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>Random House editor Jon Karp: Twenty five years ago, Andrew Tobias wrote a book that was so taboo that he couldn't even tell his parents about it. He wrote it under a pseudonym, John Reid--the real name of the Lone Ranger. It was the story of how Tobias came to terms with being gay.<p><br>That book was called THE BEST LITTLE BOY IN THE WORLD, and even today it continues to be one of the first books people read when they are coming out. For many, this book has been a life-changing reading experience, and Tobias has the letters to prove it.</p><p> <br>It has taken Andrew Tobias 13 years to write what he considers to be his most important book. This is a personal story, but it is also the story of a generation, and how it coincided with the rise of a new civil rights movement. Tobias found himself caught up in the swirl of that movement, and one of the most moving parts of this book occurs when he comes out to the President of the United States and 1,200 others at Renaissance Weekend. On the lighter side, there's also the time he finds himself at the urinal next to Sam Nunn, who led the fight against gays in the military.</p><p><br>Primarily, though, this is Tobias's story, and like any good coming of age story, it is a heartfelt account of how he grew and what he learned, from the ages of 25 to 50. It's about the distance traveled from infatuation to love, from adventure to commitment, from curiosity to self-awareness. And it's written with the same kind of self-effacing wit and intelligence and conscience that made his previous book, MY VAST FORTUNE, such a hit with reviewers and readers.</p><p><br><br></p></p><h2>Inspired by Tradition: The Architecture of Norman Davenport Askins</h2><p>Fifteen lavishly detailed Southern houses in Atlanta, Georgia, South Carolina, the Virginia Piedmont, along the Florida coasts, and in the mountains of North Carolina, from a leader in traditional architecture.<br> &nbsp;<br> Esteemed Atlanta architect Norman Davenport Askins made his name with his mastery of historical precedent. His gracious and livable designs recall such diverse sources as Italian Renaissance country villas, hillside castles in the Dordogne, and the very strong presence of the Colonial Revival and Federal houses in Atlanta and the greater South.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Inspired by Tradition</i> presents a portrait of Southern elegance through Askins&#x2019;s trademark infusion of traditional design with understated innovation and style. New color photographs of interiors and landscape, commissioned specially for the book, complement traditional hand-drawn plans and elevations.<br> &nbsp;<br> In a special section dedicated to &#x201c;Elements of Tradition,&#x201d; Askins identifies the key components of traditional design and the parameters for using them successfully. Ultimately he believes in approaching tradition with innovation and individuality&#x2014;adding touches of glamour, humor, and romance that bring his houses to life.</p><p>Norman Davenport Askins established his architectural practice in Atlanta in 1977 and is now renowned as the designer of elegant and livable houses in traditional vocabularies. An architectural historian and an architect, Askins researched the restoration of the Executive Wing of the White House as a special project for Colonial Williamsburg and served as director of restoration for John Milner Associates, a leading preservation firm. In July 2013, Askins received the inaugural A. Hays Town award from <i>Southern Living</i> magazine."Visually beautiful. . . . Through portraits of 15 homes, Norman Askins shares a variety of designs that exemplify traditional architecture, for which he is known. Architects such as Philip Shutze, Neel Reid, and James Means influenced Askins&#x2019; style as did his knowledge of French, English and Italian architecture." <br>&#x2014;<b><i>The Marietta Daily Journal</i></b><br><br>"Having lived in the South all of his life, Norman Askins is steeped in the history of old houses and traditional architecture. While it's the exterior photos of each house that lull me into daydreams, it is the interior shots that make me sit up and take notice." <br>&#x2014;<b>Peak of Chic</b></p><h2>Changing Life Patterns: Adult Development in Spiritual Direction</h2><p>EXPANDED EDITION.

Natural theology is making a comeback, stimulated as much by scientific advance as by theological and philosophical reflection. There is a growing realization that the sciences raise questions that transcend their capacity to answer them&#x2014;above all, the question of the existence of God. So how can Christian theology relate to these new developments?<br><br>In this landmark work, based on his 2009 Gifford lectures, Alister McGrath examines the apparent &#x201c;fine-tuning&#x201d; of the universe and its significance for natural theology. Exploring a wide range of physical and biological phenomena and drawing on the latest research in biochemistry and evolutionary biology, McGrath outlines our new understanding of the natural world and discusses its implications for traditional debates about the existence of God.<br><br>The celebrated Gifford Lectures have long been recognized as making landmark contributions to the discussion of natural theology. A Fine-Tuned Universe will contribute significantly to that discussion by developing a rich Trinitarian approach to natural theology that allows deep engagement with the intellectual and moral complexities of the natural world. It will be essential reading to those looking for a rigorous engagement between science and the Christian faith.</p><p><strong>Alister E. McGrath</strong> is Professor of Theology, Ministry, and Education, and Head of the Centre for Theology, Religion, and Culture at King&#x2019;s College, London.

Inspired by the Arab Spring, Joanna left behind her student life in Copenhagen and traveled to the Middle East in order to join the YPJ&#x2014;the all-female brigade of the Kurdish militia in Syria. After undergoing considerable military training, including as a saboteur and sniper, Joanna served as a YPJ fighter over several years and took part in the brutal siege of Kobani. Despite her heroism, she was taken into custody on her return to Denmark for breaking laws designed to stop citizens from joining ISIS, making her the first person to be jailed for joining the international coalition. In this raw and unflinching memoir, Joanna provides an eye-witness account of this devastating war and reveals the personal cost of the battles she has fought on and off the frontlines.</p><p><b>Joanna Palani</b> played a variety of roles for the YPJ&#x2014;the female battalion of the Syrian Kurdish group YPG, the Peshmerga, and as part of coalition forces, including the SDF, supported by US and UK special forces. Her last position in the YPJ was in a sniper unit.</p><h2>A Proper Marriage (Children of Violence, 2)</h2><p>An unconventional woman trapped in a conventional marriage, Martha Quest struggles to maintain her dignity and her sanity through the misunderstandings, frustrations, infidelities, and degrading violence of a failing marriage. Finally, she must make the heartbreaking choice of whether to sacrifice her child as she turns her back on marriage and security. <p> <em>A Proper Marriage</em> is the second novel in Doris Lessing's classic Children of Violence series of novels, each a masterpiece on its own right, and, taken together, an incisive and all-encompassing vision of our world in the twentieth century.</p></p><p><p>Winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature, Doris Lessing was one of the most celebrated and distinguished writers of our time, the recipient of a host of international awards. She wrote more than thirty books&#x2014;among them the novels <em>Martha Quest</em>, <em>The Golden Notebook</em>, and <em>The Fifth Child</em>. She died in 2013.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>It was half past four in the afternoon.</p><p>Two young women were loitering down the pavement in the shade of the sunblinds that screened the shop windows. The grey canvas of the blinds was thick, yet the sun, apparently checked, filled the long arcade with a yellow glare. It was impossible to look outwards towards the sunfilled street, and unpleasant to look in towards the mingling reflections in the window glass. They walked, therefore, with lowered gaze as if concerned about their feet. Their faces were strained and tired. One was talking indefatigably, the other unresponsive, and -- it was clear -not so much from listlessness as from a stubborn opposition. There was something about the couple which suggested guardian and ward.</p><p>At last one exclaimed, with irritated cheerfulness, Natty, if you don't get a move on, we'll be late for the doctor.'</p><p>'But, Stella, you've just said we had half an hour to fill in,' said Martha as promptly as if she had been waiting for just this point of fact to arise, so that she might argue it out to its conclusions. Stella glanced sharply at her, but before she could speak Martha continued, deepening the humorous protest, because the resentment was so strong, 'It was you who seemed to think I couldn't get through another day of married life without seeing the doctor, not me. Why you had to fix an appointment for this afternoon I can't think.' She laughed, to soften the complaint.</p><p>'It's not easy to get an appointment right away with Dr Stem. You're lucky I could arrange it for you.'</p><p>But Martha refused to be grateful. She raised her eyebrows, appeared about to argue -- and shrugged irritably.</p><p>Stella gave Martha another sharp look, tightened her lips with calculated forbearance, then exclaimed, 'That's a pretty dress there. We might as well window-shop, to fill in the time.' She went to the window; Martha lagged behind.</p><p>Stella tried to arrange herself in a position where she might see through the glass surface of reflections: a stretch of yellow-grained canvas, a grey pillar, swimming patches of breaking colour that followed each other across the window after the passers-by. The dresses displayed inside, however, remained invisible, and Stella fell to enjoying her own reflection. At once her look of shrewd good nature vanished. Her image confronted her as a dark beauty, slenderly round, immobilized by a voluptuous hauteur. Complete. Or, at least, complete until the arrival of the sexual partner her attitude implied; when she would turn on him slow, waking eyes, appear indignant, and walk away -- not without throwing him a long, ambiguous look over her shoulder. From Stella one expected these pure unmixed responses. But from her own image she had glanced towards Martha's; at once she became animated by a reformer's zeal.</p><p>From the glass Martha was looking back anxiously, as if she did not like what she saw but was determined to face it honestly. Planted on sturdy brown legs was a plump schoolgirl's body. Heavy masses of lightish hair surrounded a broad pale face. The dark eyes were stubbornly worried, the mouth set.</p><p>'What I can't understand,' said Martha, with that defensive humour which meant she was prepared to criticize herself, even accept criticism from others, provided it was not followed by advice -- 'what I can't understand is why I'm thin as a bone one month and as fat as a pig the next. You say you've got dresses you wore when you were sixteen. Well, this is the last of mine I can get on.' She laughed unhappily, trying to smooth down crumpled blue linen over her hips.</p><p>'The trouble with you is you're tired,' announced Stella. 'After all, we've none of us slept for weeks.' This sophisticated achievement put new vigour into her. She turned on Martha with determination. 'You should take yourself in hand, that's all it is. That hair style doesn't suit you -- if you can call it a hair style. If you had it cut properly, it might curl. Have you ever had it cut properly -- ?'</p><p>'But Stella,' Martha broke in, with a wail of laughter, 'it needs washing, it's untidy, it's. . .'</p><p>She clutched her hair with both hands and moved back a step as Stella moved to lay her hands on it in order to show how it should be arranged. So violent and desperate was her defence that Stella stopped, and exclaimed with an exasperated laugh, 'Well, if you don't want me to show you!'</p><p>In Martha's mind was the picture of how she had indubitably been, not more than three months ago, that picture which had been described, not only by herself but by others, as a slim blonde. Looking incredulously towards her reflection, she saw that fat schoolgirl, and shut her eyes in despair. She opened them at once as she felt Stella's hand on her arm. She shook it off.</p><p>'You must take yourself in hand. I'll take you to have your hair cut now.'</p><p>'No,' said Martha vigorously.</p><p>Checked, Stella turned back towards her own reflection. And again it arranged itself obediently. Between the languidly enticing beauty who was Stella before her glass and the energetic housewife who longed to take Martha in hand there was no connection; they were not even sisters.</p><p>Martha, sardonically watching Stella in her frozen pose, thought that she would not recognize herself if she caught a glimpse of herself walking down a street, or -- a phrase which she saw no reason not to use, even to his face -managing her husband.</p><p>Stella saw her look, turning abruptly, and said with annoyance that they would go that moment to the hairdresser.</p><p>'There isn't time,' appealed Martha desperately.</p><p>'Nonsense,' said Stella, She took Martha's hand in her own, and began tugging her along the pavement: an attractive matron whose sensuality of face and body had vanished entirely under the pressure of the greater pleasures of good management.</p></p><h2>Gustave Baumann and Friends: Artists Cards from Holidays Past</h2><p>Of all the artists who have called Santa Fe home, Gustave Baumann is among the most beloved. For nearly five decades beginning in 1918, the renowned printmaker cultivated friendships with other art colonists that were full of the colorful, artistic, humorous, small town flavor brought to life in this delightful collection of holiday cards the artists made for each other and their families.B.J.O. Nordfeldt, Ernest Blumenschein, Will Shuster, Doel Reed, Willard Nash, and John Sloan, and many more, join Baumann in the Christmas and New Year greeting cards assembled here that range from satirical and whimsical to humorous and hopeful, with commentary about the current state of the world or the artist&#x2019;s place in the world. Woodcuts, photo-engraving, lithography, etching&#x2015;the hand-drawn, hand-printed and hand-colored cards show off the personalities of the artists and how the events of the world around them touched their lives in personal, often bemused ways.The cards will be part of an exhibition at the New Mexico Museum of History (opens November 2014) curated by Jean Moss and Palace of the Governors Press director and printmaker Thomas Leech.</p><p>Jean Moss is an antiquarian bookseller in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

It is here that reality is held suspended and emptiness can fill the mind with words, music, dance, and mysticism. A.L. Sadler translates the mysteries of Noh, Kyogen, and Kabuki in his groundbreaking book, <i>Japanese Plays</i>. A seminal classic in its time, it provides a cross-section of Japanese theater that gives the reader a sampler of its beauty and power.<ul><li>The power of Noh is in its ability to create an iconic world that represents the attributes that the Japanese hold in highest esteem: family, patriotism, and honor.</li><li>Kyogen plays provide comic relief often times performed between the serious and stoic Noh plays. Similarly, Sadler's translated Kyogen pieces are layered between the Noh and the Kabuki plays.</li><li>The Kabuki plays were the theater of the common people of Japan. The course of time has given them the patina of folk art making them precious cultural relics of Japan. Sadler selected these pieces for translation because of their lighter subject matter and relatively upbeat endings&#x2014;ideal for a western readership. More linear in their telling and pedestrian in the lessons learned these plays show the difficulties of being in love when a society is bent on conformity and paternal rule.</li></ul>The end result found in <i>Japanese Plays</i> is a wonderful selection of classic Japanese dramatic literature sure to enlighten and delight.</p><p><b>A.L.

A devoted teacher of the game, he is a bestselling author whose popular monthly articles have appeared in <i>Golf Digest </i>magazine for more than thirty years. Watson lives with his wife, Hilary, on their farm near Kansas City, Kansas. Visit him online at tomwatson.com.<br><br>Nick Seitz&nbsp;was editorial director at <i>Golf Digest </i>before becoming the magazine&#x2019;s editor at large. He has won numerous sportswriting and lifetime achievement awards, and his work has been anthologized in the annual series Best Sports Stories a dozen times. He is Tom Watson&#x2019;s longtime collaborator.<b> <b>INTRODUCTION BY NICK SEITZ</b> </b> <br> <br>I&#x2019;VE BEEN COLLABORATING ON instruction writing with Tom Watson for thirty years now, and been a grateful recipient of his swing advice. My grip will never be strong enough to suit him, but he persists. Boy, does he persist.<br> <br>You get the feeling that he cares as much about your game as he cares about his own, and that he enjoys working and playing with average golfers as much as with tour players. He has gone overseas for The Open a week early to play links courses with old high-school pals from Kansas City. He relishes coaching his partners in pro-ams and corporate outings.<br> <br>A strong traditionalist, he just plain loves all aspects of the game, from its earliest history to its latest techniques. As he grows older himself, he has developed a special feel for instruction that promotes longevity. If that doesn&#x2019;t make him unique among the great players, it makes him one of the rare few.<br> <br>&#x201c;The most amazing thing about him,&#x201d; says Jerry Tarde, the editor in chief of <i>Golf Digest,</i> &#x201c;is that his interest in the instructional aspects of the game remains undimmed by the passage of time. As opposed to other superstars who either have a withering interest or never had much at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>Watson&#x2019;s quest for learning and improving is never-ending, and his own swing reflects it. Leading teachers and players believe he is swinging better than he&#x2019;s ever swung.<br> <br>On the practice range at a major championship not long ago, Padraig Harrington turned around to see whose shots were making such a crisp, pure sound. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never heard or seen a ball hit like that,&#x201d; Harrington marveled. It was Watson.<br> <br>You no doubt are familiar with Watson&#x2019;s age-defying feats in recent years. He lost the 2009 British Open in a playoff at nearly sixty years of age and not long removed from hip replacement surgery, captivating the entire world of sports and a broader public as well.<br> <br>In 2010 he hit the leaderboard in the early rounds of the Masters, made the cut, and finished under par in a tie for 18th place. Then he made the cut in the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, where he won it in 1982, playing on a special exemption probably meant to be sentimental and ceremonial. Watson doesn&#x2019;t do sentimental and ceremonial.<br> <br>He was paired for the first two rounds with young international stars Ryo Ishikawa of Japan and Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland. Their ages combined didn&#x2019;t total his sixty. Watson finished 29th&#x2014;ahead of both of them.<br> <br>At one point over the weekend, a young man in the gallery shouted, &#x201c;You rock, Tom Watson!&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s fitting that Watson became the second golf professional emeritus at the five-star Greenbrier resort in West Virginia, succeeding the late Sam Snead. Snead could have given Old Man River two a side; he was the oldest man to win a PGA Tour title (at fifty-two) and contend in a major championship (third in the PGA Championship at sixty-two).<br> <br>He is one of the role models Watson credits in this book. Both had long swings built to last and competitive fires that never needed stoking.<br> <br>So how does a legendary golfer produce a book like this? How much does Watson really get involved? Here&#x2019;s a snapshot of the process. He and I and Dom Furore, a top golf photographer, get together for a week at a golf course, in this case the Greenbrier. I know that sounds enviable, but consider that the work days began at dawn and didn&#x2019;t end till dusk.<br> <br>Watson demonstrates a topic, Dom photographs it digitally, I capture Watson&#x2019;s commentary on a tape recorder. Afterward the recording is transcribed with copies for Watson and me, and Dom prints the photos. Watson picks the best pictures, often making notes on the proof sheets to suggest graphic highlighting. Watson and I go back and forth until we&#x2019;re satisfied with the text, then we both review the finished layouts. He could not be more involved in the entire process, start to finish.<br> <br>A word of explanation to our left-handed and/or lady golfing friends. We realize that the accepted language of the game isn&#x2019;t ideal, intended as it is for right-handed, male players. Over the years, leading publications like <i>Golf Digest</i> have experimented with &#x201c;neutral&#x201d; references that seemed forced and unnatural, and caused more confusion for most people than the usual terminology. We hope you will make the conversions that may well have become second nature by now.<br> <br>And I hope Watson&#x2019;s swing advice helps you as much as it has helped me over the golfing years. May there be many more for all of us. It&#x2019;s not called the game of a lifetime frivolously.<br> <br>� 2011 Tom Watson</p><h2>The Fall of the Roman Empire: A New History</h2><p>In AD 378, the Roman Empire had been the unrivalled superpower of Europe for well over four hundred years.

Dietrich Bartel then turns to more detailed considerations of the musical-rhetorical figures that were developed in Baroque treatises and publications. After brief biographical sketches of the major theorists, Bartel examines those theorists&#x2019; interpretation and classification of the figures. The book concludes with a detailed presentation of the musical-rhetorical figures, in which each theorist&#x2019;s definitions are presented in the original language and in parallel English translations.&nbsp;Bartel&#x2019;s clear, detailed analysis of German Baroque musical-rhetorical figures, combined with his careful translations of interpretations of those figures from a wide range of sources, make this book an indispensable introduction and resource for all students of Baroque music.</p><p>Dietrich Bartel is an associate professor in the Department of Music at Canadian Mennonite Bible College (affiliated with University of Manitoba).Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Gypsy Ballads</h2><p>Federico Garc�a Lorca wrote the Gypsy Ballads between 1924 and 1927. When the book was published it caused a sensation in the literary world. Drawing on the traditional Spanish ballad form, Lorca described his Romancero Gitano as the poem of Andaluc�a...A book that hardly expresses visible Andalusia at all, but where hidden Andaluc�a trembles&#x2019;. Seeking to relate the nature of his proud and troubled region of Spain, he drew on a traditional gypsy form; yet the homely, unpretentious style of these poems barely disguises the undercurrents of conflicted identity never far from Lorca&#x2019;s work. This bilingual edition, translated by Jane Duran and Glora Garc�a Lorca, is illuminated by photos and illustrations of and by Lorca, his own reflections on the poems and introductory notes by leading Lorca scholars: insights into the Romancero and the history of the Spanish ballad form by Andr�s Soria Olmedo; notes on the dedications by Manuel Fern�ndez-Montesinos; Lorca's 1935 lecture; and an introduction by Professor Christopher Maurer to the problems and challenges faced by translators of Lorca. True to the spirit of Lorca&#x2019;s remarkable artistry, the book has been designed by John Morgan, one the UK&#x2019;s most imaginative typographic designers, with a gradated green cloth cover embossed on the front and back with Lorca&#x2019;s own playful line drawings.</p><p>Federico Garc�a Lorca (1898-1936) is one of the most popular of modern European poets and playwrights. His poems and plays about creation, desire and death have been translated into dozens of languages and transformed into song, ballet, opera and painting. Fascinated by the folk music of his native Spain, Lorca wrote two books inspired by gypsy rhythms: Poem of the Deep Song (on the world of flamenco and cante jondo) and the best-selling Gypsy Ballads. In Poet in New York (written 1929-1930) he turns the American city into an image of universal loneliness, and in tragedies like Yerma, Blood Wedding, and The House of Bernarda Alba he takes the measure of human longing and of the social repression that would contribute to his early death (he was shot by right-wing forces at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War). With this collection of ballads, carefully translated by Jane Dur�n and Gloria Garc�a Lorca, the poet transforms into metaphor and myth the fantasy and reality of a marginalized people."Their imagery is often vividly synaesthetic, inventive and unexpected . . . the poems celebrate and lament the concrete and the mysterious, in language that manages both to be startlingly fresh and obviously in debt to a rich tradition, that of the traditional Spanish ballad and its offshoots." &#x2014;Gyln Pursglove, <i>Acumen</i><br><br>"Their imagery is often vividly synaesthetic, inventive and unexpected, yet grounded in common experience; the poems celebrate and lament the concrete and the mysterious, in language that manages both to be startlingly fresh and obviously in debt to a rich tradition, that of the traditional Spanish ballad and its offshoots." &#x2014;Gyln Pursglove, acumen-poetry.co.uk</p><h2>Anne Bonny &amp; Mary Read: The Golden Age of Piracy's Most Famous Women</h2><p>*Includes historic illustrations depicting Anne Bonny, Mary Read, and important people in their lives.<br> *Includes a profile of Anne and Mary from the famous English pirate history "A General History of the Pyrates".<br> *Discusses common legends about Anne and Mary, separating fact from fiction.<br> *Includes a Bibliography for further reading. <br> &#x201c;NOW we are to begin a History full of surprizing Turns and Adventures; I mean, that of Mary Read and Anne Bonny, alias Bonn, which were the true Names of these two Pyrates; the odd Incidents of their rambling Lives are such, that some may be tempted to think the whole Story no better than a Novel or Romance; but since it is supported by many thousand Witnesses, I mean the People of Jamaica, who were present at their Tryals, and heard the Story of their Lives, upon the first discovery of their Sex; the Truth of it can be no more contested, than that there were such Men in the World, as Roberts and Black-beard...&#x201d; - Captain Charles Johnson, A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the most notorious Pyrates <br> One of the most famous pirates of all time, and possibly the most famous woman to ever become one, was Anne Bonny. The Irish-born girl moved with her family to the Bahamas at a young age in the early 18th century, which at that time was a hotbed for piracy by the likes of Blackbeard, but the redhead with a fiery temper would go on to forge her own reputation. After marrying a poor sailor who accepted clemency to give up piracy, Anne began a legendary affair with Calico Jack Rackam and became pregnant with his child, but that did not stop them from plundering the high seas aboard his pirate ship Revenge, at least until they were captured by British authorities. Anne avoided execution by &#x201c;pleading her belly&#x201d;, getting a temporary stay of execution due to her pregnancy. <br> Among all the pirates of the &#x201c;Golden Age of Piracy&#x201d;, none were as unique as Mary Read, who was one of just two known women to be tried as a pirate during the Golden Age, alongside her own crewmate (and possible lover) Anne Bonny. Like Anne, Mary Read was an illegitimate child who spent some of her childhood dressed up as and disguised as a little boy through incredibly strange circumstances. But unlike her future shipmate, Mary ultimately took a liking to it, and she continued to disguise her gender to take on roles reserved for men, including in the British army. During that time, she fell in love with a Flemish soldier and eventually married him. <br> Mary Read might have been content to live out her life with her husband in Holland, but after his death, she headed for the West Indies, only to have her ship commandeered by pirates. But Read, who had worked on a ship before, was only too happy to join the pirate crew and play the role of privateer. And in 1720, that crew was captured by Calico Jack, who already had his lover Anne Bonny as part of his crew and now unwittingly added a second female when Mary opted to join. <br> Together the three played a legendary role as shipmates and possible lovers while continuing their piracy around the Bahamas, only to eventually be captured by authorities in October 1720. Most of the crew was executed, but Mary was able to successfully &#x201c;plead the belly&#x201d; and thereby receiving a stay of execution. This spared her the noose, but Mary would die of illness while still imprisoned in 1721. <br> Anne Bonny &amp; Mary Read chronicles the mysterious lives and legends of the two famous female pirates, attempting to separate fact from fiction while analyzing her lasting legacy. Along with pictures depicting Anne Bonny, Mary Read, and other important people, you will learn about the famous pirates like you never have before, in no time at all.</p><p></p><h2>Mona and Other Tales</h2><p><b>Mona and Other Tales<i> </i></b>covers Reinaldo Arenas's entire career: his recently rediscovered debut (which got him a job at the Biblioteca Nacional in Havana), stories written in a political prison, and some of his last works, written in exile.

In Shots Fired in Anger, Lieutenant Colonel John B. George recounts his brutal experiences in frontline jungle warfare and examines the weapons, tactics, equipment, and combat mentalities that won and lost the fight. For George, marksmanship was always more than a hobby it was a preparation for national defense. When he is inducted into the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant, he&#39;s shocked to see that the military lacks the same enthusiasm: the troops have not been taught to shoot or to march, and they are commanded by men obsessed with obsolete tactics and eyewash. It is only by desperate negotiating that he is able to secure two days of rifle training for his platoon before they are shipped to the Pacific. On Guadalcanal, George leads from the front with a sniper&#39;s calm and a scientist&#39;s eye for detail, analyzing what works and what doesn&#39;t from the terrifying but suicidal Japanese Banzai charge to the reliable and effective M1 Garand in trial by fire. The author interviews his fellow soldiers, questions prisoners, disassembles captured and borrowed weapons, and uses, commands, and faces these strategies and implements of war on the battlefield. All of this comes together in a fascinating combination of personal memoir and combat dossier. Few other writers have ever been able to rival George&#39;s combination of field experience and excellent storytelling. Laced with informative illustrations and lightened by stories of hunting, drinking, and military jokes played in the face of death, Shots Fired in Anger is one of the most important and entertaining firsthand accounts to arise from WWII.</p><p>John B. George loves to shoot rifles. This book tells his story as a Lieutenant in the infantry, serving with the U.S. Army during the battle for Guadalcanal, during World War II. He joined the Illinois National Guard to be able to do more shooting. As luck would have it, this unit was called up to active duty before the United States entered the war. The story of battle is told more like that of an enlisted rifleman than an officer. But through the story of the long running battle, with the elements being every bit as much of a challenge as the enemy, he tells of the weapons used by both sides. His colorful descriptions of the life they lived show just how difficult conditions were. The account tells of Guadalcanal from the time the Army first arrived until they were finally pulled out. This gives the best view of what World War II was like in the Pacific Theater of any I have read. The remainder of the book is devoted to his descriptions of the various weapons used by both sides. He tells in detail about each and gives his assessment of the military value of each. The book is a must read for anyone interested in the history of World War II in the Pacific and particularly to those interested in collecting the arms of that period. --Robert C.

In Vietnam, this was resisted by the Viet Minh leading to the First Indochina War. By 1954, the French army was on the defensive and determined to force the Viet Minh into a decisive set-piece battle at Dien Bien Phu.</p><p> Over the past five decades, Western authors have generally followed a standard narrative of the siege of Dien Bien Phu, depicting the Viet Minh besiegers as a faceless horde which overwhelmed the intrepid garrison by sheer weight of numbers, superior firepower, and logistics. However, a wealth of new Vietnamese-language sources tell a very different story, revealing for the first time the true Viet Minh order of battle and the details of the severe logistical constraints within which the besiegers had to operate. Using these sources, complemented by interviews with French veterans and research in the French Army and French Foreign Legion archives, this book, now publishing in paperback, provides a new telling of the climactic battle in the Indochina War, the conflict that set the stage for the Vietnam War a decade later.</p></p><p><p><b>Dr Kevin M.

No-one interested in the First Indochina War (1946-1954) can afford to ignore it and it should also be read by all interested in the Second Indochina War (1959-1975). Boylan (by courtesy of Merle Pribbenow's translations) has made fuller use than any previous historian of Vietnamese Communist literature on this campaign, while Olivier has dived deep into French archival sources and interviewed an impressive array of veterans. The result is a work which busts myths and corrects oft-repeated errors. [...] For decades Bernard Fall has been venerated as an authority on the First Indochina War, his "Hell in a Very Small Place" long regarded as the classic account of the campaign. Boylan and Olivier are not intimidated by Fall's venerable status. Fall did not have access to some of the sources that Boylan and Olivier have used and they convincingly demonstrate that he got some things wrong. It is to be hoped that Fall's great work will continue to be read, but on the military events of the campaign Boylan's and Olivier's book now sets the standard.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Dr J. P.

A Frenchwoman of Greek-English birth, Devi became an admirer of German National Socialism in the late 1920s. Deeply impressed by its racial heritage and caste-system, she emigrated to India, where she developed her racial ideology, in the early 1930s. Her works have been reissued and distributed through various neo-Nazi networks and she has been lionized as a foremother of Nazi ideology. Her appeal to neo-Nazi sects lies in the very eccentricity of her thought - combining Aryan supremacism and anti-Semitism with Hinduism, social Darwinisn, animal rights, and a fundamentally biocentric view of life - and has resulted in curious, yet potent alliances in radical ideology.<br> As one of the earliest Holocaust deniers and the first to suggest that Adolf Hitler was an avatar-- a god come to earth in human form to restore the world to a golden age - Devi became a fixture in the shadowy neo-Nazi world. In <b>Hitler's Priestess</b>, Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke examines how someone with so little tangible connection to Nazi Germany became such a powerful advocate of Hitler's misanthropy.<br> <b>Hitler's Priestess</b> illuminates the life of a woman who achieved the status of a prophetess for her penchant for redirecting authentic religious energies in the service of regenerate fascism.</p></p><p>Savitri Devi&#39;s influence on neo-Nazism and other hybrid strains of mystical fascism has been continuous since the mid-1960s.

Only a storm chaser can confirm when a tornado is present&#x2015;and help meteorologists warn nearby towns. <br> <br> Whenever severe weather threatens, storm chasers hit the road to hunt for tornadoes, hurricanes, or violent storms. Some drive thousands of miles in just a few days as they follow a storm system from Iowa to Texas.

Specially trained Hurricane Hunters hop into aircraft packed with scientific instruments to fly deep into powerful hurricanes, hoping to reach the eye of the storm. <br> <br> Are storm chasers a bunch of foolish daredevils? Not at all. Many are scientists while others are professional photographers and videographers.

Although curiosity seekers still chase storms, trained storm chasing is now a recognized segment of science, albeit a dangerous one. With the advent of newer meteorological equipment and techniques, earlier warning systems are in place, alerting more people more quickly and saving untold lives. Miller cites global warming and increased carbon dioxide levels as major contributors to extreme weather, and outlines the role of meteorologists and the role meteorology plays in storm prediction. <strong>Accessible text, engaging diagrams, and dynamic photographs make this a surefire hit for budding scientists and their teachers.</strong> Back matter includes instructions for creating a weather station and what&#x2019;s needed for a weather emergency kit." &#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"This pleasing book on storm chasers is packed with information.

Vanessa&#x2019;s experimental work places her at the vanguard of early twentieth-century art, as does her role in helping introduce many key names &#x2013; C�zanne, Matisse, Picasso &#x2013; to an unsuspecting public in 1910. Virginia took these artistic innovations and applied them to literature, pushing the boundaries of form, narrative and language to find a voice uniquely her own.Yet their private lives were just as experimental. Vanessa&#x2019;s marriage to art critic Clive Bell was shaken early on by his flirtation with her sister, and Virginia&#x2019;s marriage to Leonard Woolf placed him more in the role of carer than husband as he tried to meet the needs of his wife&#x2019;s fragile mental health.

However their apprehension about the fate of the island increased as they anticipated a Japanese attack in the fall of 1941. Shortly after attack on Pearl Harbor, Guam was bombed and the Japanese invasion soon followed. Since Guam was not heavily fortified it soon fell to the invading Japanese. <br><p>In the takeover of the island, the Japanese practiced a swift brutality against the captive Americans as well as native population, and then immediately removed the American military and civilian personnel to Japan.

Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, however, the Japanese invaded the tiny island, captured the Americans, and shipped them to Japan. Drawing on interviews with survivors, diaries, and archival records, Roger Mansell documents the mostly unknown story of these American POWs. The men endured horrific hardships, many of which are chronicled in this book for the first time. Also included are moving stories of their liberation, transportation home, and the aftermath of their ordeal.Roger Mansell was born in 1935 in Brooklyn, New York. After graduating from Mepham Highschool in Wantaugh, NY, he attended Brown University. Commissioned in the U.S. Army Artillery, he was stationed in Korea then at Fort Bliss, Texas. Having completed his military sevice, in 1962, he moved to California and a successful business career. It was to be the deep impression made upon him by an employee who, as a child, had been a prisoner under the Japanese during WWII, that set him on a course to discover more about the war.. When he met a veteran who had been taken prisoner by the Japanese on Guam, Mansell realized that many of the ex POWs, now elderly, had never told anyone about their experiences in what was a crucially important part of the history of the war in the Pacific. <br><p>After he retired from a career in business in the 1990s, he began researching the allied POWs of the Japanese, a gruesome story that had been largely buried in inaccessible archives. Over more than twenty years, he made multiple and extended visits to the National Archives Modern Military Records in College Park, MD, and to the Hoover Institution Library and Archives, as well as military historical centers, scanning and photographing thousands of documents that had never before been been centralized or complied. <br></p><p>Since the beginning of Mansell's project, his chief goal was to compile a database of more than 100,000 records to document what happened to every Allied soldier who was captured by Japanese forces during the war. Approximately 90 percent completed at the time of his death in 2010, this vast database contains information on when soldiers were captured, where they were interned, and whether they died or were repatriated at the end of the war, as well as the conditions of their captivity.<br></p><p>He founded the Center for Research Allied POWs Under the Japanese which posted the research on its website, www.mansell.com. That website has been turned over his colleague, Wes Injerd.<br></p><p>He turned his retirement into a full-time job not only undertaking research and elaborating the website, but assisting the hundreds of people who came to his website looking for information about what had happened to friends, fathers, grandfathers, and others. As one result of his research, Mansell has helped several families locate the remains of soldiers who were missing in action during the war; he has also frequently been consulted by researchers around the world seeking information about individual soldiers or the camps in which they were interned.<br><br>Linda Goetz Holmes, completed Captured by editing Roger Mansell's work, She was the first Pacific War historian appointed to advise the government s Interagency Working Group declassifying documents on World War II crimes.

His lyric, deceptively simple prose conjures a world where the default setting is violence, a world of hunting and fishing, gambling and losing, drinking and poaching&#x2014;a world most of us have never seen. In the chilling title novella (selected for the anthologies New Stories from the South: The Year's Best, 1999 and <em>Best Mystery Stories of the Century</em>), three wild boys confront a mythic game warden as mysterious and deadly as the river they haunt. And, as a weathered, hand-painted sign reads: "Jesus is not coming;" This terrain isn't pretty, isn't for the weak of heart, but in these desperate, lost people, Franklin somehow finds the moments of grace that make them what they so abundantly are: human.</p></p><p><b>Penzler Pick, December 1999</b>: As the editor of an annual series for Houghton Mifflin titled <i>Best American Mystery Stories</i>, I read scores, if not hundreds, of little magazines in search of the best crime fiction published that year. One story that came to light from the <i>Texas Review</i> was "Poachers" by Tom Franklin, which I thought was easily the most original and memorable tale of 1998. It went on to win the Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America and became the title of Franklin's first book, a short story collection of such distinction that it has already provided a shoo-in for spring 2000s <i>Best American Mystery Stories of the Century</i>. <p> "Poachers" is no ordinary tale of detection but rather a mood piece that will remind the reader of the best of James Lee Burke. Set in the swamps of the deep South, it is a riveting tale of three brothers who are so violent and amoral that they will kill anyone or anything in their path. One of their victims is a young lawman who was much loved, causing the locals to bring in their own hired gun, a game warden of legendary skill as a hunter of poachers. One by one, he tracks down the crazed brothers in a quest for justice. </p><p> The other stories in this beautifully produced little volume are also superb. While there is occasional humor, this is not a collection to read if you're in the mood for P.G. Wodehouse or Dave Barry. The dark woods and hollows and the unforgiving swamps and their inhabitants do not make for a sunshiny reading experience. As the old wooden sign in Poachers announces, "Jesus Is Not Coming." Franklin's first novel will be published in 2000 and I, for one, can't wait. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p><p>Tom Franklin is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter</em>, which won the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Book Prize and the Crime Writers' Association's Gold Dagger Award.

This stunning large-format collection of over two hundred full-color photographs brings to life the sixty chapels located throughout Notre Dame's beloved campus, many of which are tucked away in little-known settings waiting to be discovered by readers of this volume for the first time.</p> <p>At Notre Dame, chapels are found in a number of academic buildings and in every residence hall. Mass is celebrated daily in some of these halls during term, and it is not uncommon to see students and staff stopping in them for moments of quiet meditation and prayer. <i>The Chapels of Notre Dame</i> captures these sanctuaries, as well as the older chapels, the apsidal chapels of the Basilica, and the Congregation of Holy Cross chapels. The text, by well-known Notre Dame professor Lawrence S. Cunningham, provides a picture of the worship in these chapels along with reflections on the traditions, history, architecture, and art works that adorn them. His brief descriptions evoke a powerful sense of presence, worship, and prayer.</p> <p>Matt Cashore's dramatic photographs include the campus landscape, interiors and exteriors of the chapels, and people worshipping in varied seasons, lighting, and moods. His photographs offer fresh ways to view the charming sloped roof of All Souls Chapel, the large collection of relics assembled from the days of Father Sorin in the Reliquary Chapel in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, the Holy Cross Chapel in the new Stinson-Remick Engineering Hall, the striking stained-glass windows in the Moreau Seminary Chapel of the Sacred Heart, and the unique chapels in each of the residence halls.</p> <p>For alumni who have participated in baptisms, weddings, anniversary celebrations, prayer services, and other liturgical rites on campus, <i>The Chapels of Notre Dame</i> will not disappoint. Prospective students, members of the Notre Dame family, and friends and supporters who have seen the university only from a distance will get an inside view of one of the most beautiful campuses in the world and a unique contemplative side of Notre Dame.</p></p><p>Lawrence S. Cunningham is the John A. O'Brien Professor of Theology at the University of Notre Dame. He is the author and editor of twenty-five books, including A Brief History of Saints.<br><br>Matt Cashore is the senior university photographer for the University of Notre Dame. His work has been published in Sports Illustrated, the New York Times, and ESPN The Magazine. His most recent book is Celebrating Notre Dame.&#34;It is striking that the idea for the publication of this book came not from the university&#39;s officers nor its media office but from a lay person who was inspired by the beauty of one of our chapels when visiting the campus. Like the ancient psalmist who cried out, &#39;I have loved the beauty of thy house, O Lord&#39; (Psalm 26:8), this visitor saw that the chapels on Notre Dame&#39;s campus are an integral part of its story. She was so right that her idea was taken up immediately by the university itself. This beautiful volume is the result of that inspiration.&#34; (Theodore M.

Scott shared her remarkable journey out of Mormonism as she uncovered shocking inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and contradictions in the faith she had loved and lived.Thirty years later, Mormonism and Mormon scholarship have evolved with the times. In this third, revised and updated edition of her well-known book, Scott keeps pace with changes and advances in Mormonism, and reveals formidable new challenges to its claims and teachings.The Mormon Mirage provides fascinating, carefully documented insights into� DNA research&#x2019;s withering implications for the Book of Mormon� the impact of new &#x201c;revelations&#x201d; on Latter-day Saint (LDS) race relations� new findings about Mormon history� increasing publicity about LDS splinter groups, particularly polygamous ones� recent disavowals of long-held doctrines by church leadership� the rise of Mormon apologetics on the InternetMore than a riveting, insider&#x2019;s scrutiny of the Mormon faith, this book is a testimony to the trustworthiness of Scripture and the grace of Jesus Christ.</p><p>Latayne C.

It is thorough, historically accurate, well researched and documented with up to date evidence that substantiates even further the falseness and deceptiveness of Mormonism. Her presentation of the errors of Mormonism is admirably balanced by her honest portrayal of not only the positive values of the Mormon Church, but in sharing her soul-wrenching resolve to leave the religion she had so loved, to embrace only Biblical truths - a heart-tugging decision that I can well identify with.</p><h2>The Chaco War 1932&#x2013;35: South America&#x2019;s greatest modern conflict (Men-at-Arms)</h2><p>Often over-shadowed by contemporary events in China and Japan, the Chaco War (1932-1935) was a massive territorial war between Bolivia and Paraguay, which cost almost&nbsp; 100,000 lives. It was sparked by Bolivia's attempts to capture a stretch of the Paraguay River to gain access to the Atlantic. An old fashioned territorial dispute, the contested area was the Gran Chaco Boreal, a 100,000-square mile region of swamp, jungle and pampas with isolated fortified towns. The wilderness terrain made operations difficult and costly as the war see-sawed between the two sides. Bolivian troops, under the command of a German general, Hans von Kundt, had early successes, but these stalled in the face of a massive mobilization programme by the Paraguans which saw their force increase in size ten-fold to 60,000 men. Both sides acquired 'modern' technology including tanks and planes in an attempt to seize the initiative but by 1935 both sides were exhausted and a ceasefire concluded. This book sheds light on a vicious territorial war that waged in the jungles and swamps of the Gran Chaco and is illustrated with rare photographs and especially commissioned artwork.</p><p>Alejandro de Quesada is a Florida-based military history writer, an experienced researcher and collector of militaria, photos and documents, who runs an archive and historical consultancy for museums and films as a secondary business.

In <i>The Wages of History</i>, Amy Tyson enters the world of the public history interpreters at Minnesota's Historic Fort Snelling to investigate how they understand their roles and experience their daily work. Drawing on archival research, personal interviews, and participant observation, she reframes the current discourse on history museums by analyzing interpreters as laborers within the larger service and knowledge economies.<br><br>Although many who are drawn to such work initially see it as a privilege&#x2015;an opportunity to connect with the public in meaningful ways through the medium of history&#x2015;the realities of the job almost inevitably alter that view. Not only do interpreters make considerable sacrifices, both emotional and financial, in order to pursue their work, but their sense of special status can lead them to avoid confronting troubling conditions on the job, at times fueling tensions in the workplace.<br><br>This case study also offers insights&#x2015;many drawn from the author's seven years of working as an interpreter at Fort Snelling&#x2015;into the way gendered roles and behaviors from the past play out among the workers, the importance of creative autonomy to historical interpreters, and the ways those on public history's front lines both resist and embrace the site's more difficult and painful histories relating to slavery and American Indian genocide.</p><p>Amy Tyson is assistant professor of history at DePaul University."A sophisticated analysis that brings together the politics of gender with the aesthetics of historical performance and the materialist sensibilities of political economy&#x2015;truly a multifaceted approach that adds something quite new to the critical literature on public history."&#x2015;Cathy Stanton, author of <i>The Lowell Experiment: Public History in a Postindustrial City</i><br><br>"Tyson advances a new perspective to consider when assessing living history interpretation for appropriateness, effectiveness, and viability. Essential."&#x2015;<i>Choice</i><br><br>"Straightforward, analytically clear, and quietly passionate . . . The book ends with a plea for recognition of the social worth of the work of museum interpretation."&#x2015;<i>Indiana Magazine of History</i><br><br>"This book does an excellent job of demonstrating the difficulties inherent in first-person interpretation [especially concerning historically 'accurate' views of gender, class, race, and religion] ensuring it a well-deserved place on public history syllabi."&#x2015;<i>American Historical Review</i><br><br>"Very readable . . . accessible to those both inside and outside academia. . . . This book would be useful for a labor studies class, particularly in generating discussions of the vast array of jobs that require some level of emotional labor. Each of the chapters can be read on its own, without requiring knowledge from earlier parts of the book to understand later portions."&#x2015;<i>Labor Studies Journal</i><br><br>"Amy M. Tyson's engaging book examines an overlooked subject in public history: the workers who directly serve audiences, or, those on the 'front lines.' . . . Chapters 4 and 5 are particularly well written and provocative. In chapter 4 Tyson investigates the strong desires of the front-line workers (including herself) to display their understanding of historical authenticity and the supervisors' assertions of their own power to impose restriction son the workers when they acted away from the given script. . . . Tyson is hopeful, I believe, that individuals who supervise and lead the 'emotional proletariat' will gain a more empathetic and respectful relationship with their workers."&#x2015;<i>Journal of American History</i><br><br>"Tyson has written a book that would make [historical] interpreters proud. It should be an eye opener to anyone who is interested in the real trenches of history, located not in the academy, but in American museums."&#x2015;<i>Registar of the Kentucky Historical Society</i><br><br>"According to Tyson, this emotionally fraught work culture, in which employees feel simultaneous emotional fulfillment and exhaustion, affects both the efficacy of the site as a living history museum and employees' personal and professional happiness."&#x2015;<i>Public Archaeology</i><br><br>"As more public history institutions deal with 'difficult' histories, <i>The Wages of History</i> should prove the necessity of preparing workers well while honoring their experience and authority."&#x2015;<i>American Quarterly</i></p><h2>Collaboration: Uniting Our Gifts in Ministry</h2><p>Despite the focus on collaborative ministry in several church documents and pastoral letters in recent years, two frequently asked questions still persist: "What is it?" and "How do we make it work?" In <i>Collaboration: Uniting Our Gifts in Ministry</i>, authors Loughlan Sofield, S.T., and Carroll Juliano, S.H.C.J., provide answers to these questions based on their work of over twenty years with thousands of Christians who are actively working to give birth to a ministry that calls on all Christians to share their baptismal gifts. <i>Collaboration</i> offers a comprehensive model and a wealth of practical strategies to help ministers navigate their way through the sometimes messy, sometimes painful issues they confront. Chronicling the many developments in the church's life and practice since the issue of collaborative ministry first came into focus, they identify some of the myths and obstacles that hinder effective collaborative ministry and offer concrete examples of why and how collaboration is working. Their careful use of a full range of contemporary ecclesial documents helps readers concretize a sometimes nebulous understanding of collaborative ministry. And they show that effective collaboration requires both a collaborative spirituality and the specific skills such as group leadership, dealing with conflict, and learning to confront. Reminding us that "a non-collaborative church is a church of maintenance rather than a church of mission," the authors provide an invaluable resource to enliven the church's mission and to make the vision of collaborative ministry proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council a reality.</p><p></p><h2>Assuming Names: a con artist&#39;s masquerade (Criminal Mischief)</h2><p>When it was over, there were a lot of questions. The detectives were embarrassed but they still wanted answered, "How did a 15-year-old runaway successfully pose as a world traveled countess?" The newspapers turned it back on them, practically sneering, "How did she do it while under investigation by the FBI, DEA, and Interpol?" The Mafia had been demanding the same thing for six months, "What is your real name?" And the psychologists asked the question they always ask, "Why?" It&#x2019;s the why of it that will keep a girl in trouble. Assuming Names is the true story of a young con artist. It&#x2019;s the tale of a runaway that assumed the title of countess and then went on to fool the FBI, DEA, and Interpol&#x2014;as well as a number of other celebrities and institutions&#x2014;with an elaborate tale of world intrigue.</p><p></p><h2>Holy Mother : Being the Life of Sri Sarada Devi, Wife of Sri Ramakrishna and Helpmate in His Mission</h2><p>This book beautifully describes the life of Holy Mother, Sri Sarada Devi, and will inspire spiritual seekers of all faiths. Holy Mother, the wife of Sri Ramakrishna, the 19th century God man of India, has been described as the Divine Mother of the Universe. &#34;Outwardly Holy Mother lived as an average Hindu woman, devoting herself to the faithful discharge of her household duties, often unpleasant and frustrating. Inwardly she practised total non-attachment and remained undisturbed by what happened in the physical world. Never did her mind deviate from contact with God.&#34; Written by Swami Nikhilananda, a direct disciple of Holy Mother, this 384 page book contains chapters on &#34;What Holy Mother Taught&#34;, &#34;Spiritual Practices&#34;, &#34;Women of India&#34;, as well as, 50 pictures. For more information about Holy Mother, visit www.ramakrishna.org.</p><p>When Holy Mother came to Dakshineswar at the age of sixteen, Sri Ramakrishna asked her whether she had come to pull him down to a worldly life. Without hesitation she said, "No, I am here to help you realize your Chosen Ideal." From then on, Holy Mother lived with Sri Ramakrishna as his spiritual companion, devoted wife, disciple, and always the nun. She was the embodiment of purity. Her mind was never sullied by the faintest breath of worldliness, though she lived with Sri Ramakrishna for the greater part of fourteen years. She never missed communion with God, whom she described as lying in the palm of her hand, though she was engaged day and night in various activities. <p>Holy Mother was an unusual awakener of souls. With her disciples she served as teacher, dissolving their doubts, as mother, who through love and compassion won their hearts, and as the Divinity, who assured them of liberation. Herself nearly illiterate, through simple words she taught them the most profound truths. Her affectionate maternal love tamed their rebellious spirits; but her great power lay in her solicitude for all. Often she said, "I am the Mother, who will look after them if not I?" She encouraged them when they were depressed because of slow spiritual progress, and she took upon herself their sins and iniquities, suffering on that account. </p><p>Holy Mother was conscious of her divine nature, but she rarely expressed this awareness. For many years Sri Ramakrishna practiced great austerities and formally renounced the world, but Holy Mother lived as a simple householder, surrounded by quarrelsome and greedy relatives. As a teacher she taught the realization of God alone is real, and everything else, impermanent. The human body so treasured by most people, survives cremations as only three pounds of ashes. Holy Mother -- humility itself -- claimed that she was in no way different from other devotees of the Master. Her disciples felt awed and uplifted when she blessed them by touching their head with the same hand which had touched the feet of God. She was fully aware of her disciples' present limitations and their future possibilities. No one went away from her with a downcast heart. </p><p>The outstanding virtues of Indian womanhood are courage, serenity, self-control, sweetness, compassion, wisdom, and an intuitive relationship with God. Holy Mother possessed all these virtues. Since the acquisition of such gifts is the dream of all women, Holy Mother may aptly be seen as the symbol of aspiration of women everywhere. Written by Swami Nikhilananda, "Holy Mother and the Ideal of Indian Womanhood." Published by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Madras, India.</p>Swami Nikhilananda, a direct disciple of Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi, was born in a small Indian village in 1895 and was ordained a monk of the Ramakrishna Order in 1924. After spending several years in the Himalayan monastery of his Order, during which time he made a study of Hinduism and other systems of philosophy and religion, he was sent to America in 1931. He founded the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center of New York in 1933 and was its spiritual leader until his passing away in 1973. <p>The Swami was a gifted writer, and his contributions to the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda literature cannot be overstated. His translations of the scriptures, his biographies of Sri Ramakrishna, Holy Mother and Swami Vivekananda, his compilations of the works of Swami Vivekananda, his other books and many articles in various journals and publications are permanent sources of spiritual knowledge and inspiration. Notable among these works are the following titles: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, Holy Mother, Vivekananda: A Biography, The Upanishads (Volumes I-IV), The Bhagavad Gita, Self-Knowledge, Hinduism, and Man in Search of Immortality. Many of these works were originally introduced by major publishers, such as Harper &amp; Row (New York) and George Allen &amp; Unwin (London). Time Magazine called Swami Nikhilananda's translations of The Bhagavad Gita, "The first really readable, authoritative English translation of one of the world's greatest religious classics." W. Somerset Maugham praised Self-Knowledge as a "wonderful piece of exposition." </p><p>But the Swami's monumental work, for which he will ever be remembered, is The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna. This complete translation into English from the original Bengali of the Sri Sri Ramakrishna Kathamrita, as recorded by "M," has made the immortal words of this great prophet of the nineteenth century available to countless readers throughout the world. Aldous Huxley was pleased to write a foreword to The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, and high praise was given to the book by such notable persons as Thomas Mann and Henry Miller. Time Magazine referred to The Gospel as "One of the world's most extraordinary religious documents."

Robinson&#x2019;s ambition is to find out both what it is to know a landscape, know it as extensively and intimately as possible, and what it takes to make that knowledge, the sense of the landscape itself, come alive in writing. It is a project that draws on the legacies of Thoreau and Joyce, to which Robinson brings his own polymathic gifts as cartographer, mathematician, historian, and, above all, shaper of words.<br><br>In <i>Pilgrimage</i> Robinson walked the entire coast of Airann, largest of the Aran islands. In <i>Labyrinth</i> he turns in to the island&#x2019;s interior. These two books&#x2014;parts of an inseparable whole that can, for all that, be read quite separately from each other&#x2014;constitute a vast polyphonic composition, at once encyclopedic and lyrical, scientific and surprisingly personal. Exploring the illimitable complexity and bounty contained in the seemingly limited confines of a single island, Robinson invites us to look without and within and to see the wonder of the world.</p><p><b>Tim Robinson </b>was born in 1935 and brought up in Yorkshire, England. He studied mathematics at Cambridge and worked as a teacher and artist in Istanbul, Vienna, and London. In 1972 he moved to the Aran Islands to write and make maps.

Among his books are <i>Setting Foot on the Shores of Connemara and Other Writings</i> (1996), <i>My Time in Space</i> (2001), <i>Tales and Imaginings</i> (2002), and two volumes of a projected trilogy, <i>Connemara: Listening to the Wind</i> (2006) and <i>Connemara: The Last Pool of Darknes</i>s (2008).

The 15 stories and one poem reinterpret the unicorn myth across genre and style. Caitl�n R. Kiernan&#x2019;s lesbian noir &#x201c;The Maltese Unicorn&#x201d; pits a hard-boiled rare book dealer against a sorcerous femme fatale. In Jane Yolen&#x2019;s delicate &#x201c;The Transfigured Hart,&#x201d; a bookish boy and a horse-loving girl bond over a shared obsession with a mysterious white woodland creature. Dave Smeds&#x2019;s &#x201c;Survivor&#x201d; includes elements of horror in its tale of a traumatized Vietnam vet, as does Garth Nix&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Highest Justice,&#x201d; in which a princess and a revenant queen seek revenge with the help of a unicorn. Themes of innocence lost, first love, and yearning for transcendence pervade all of the stories in this collection, giving it a haunting and melancholy feel. Readers who love the mystery and elegance of unicorns will find this a lovely homage.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>&#x201c;Unicorns in literature are fascinating, evocative, mysterious, and elusive, and with <i>The Unicorn Anthology</i>, editors Peter S.

He is hired, often by distraught husbands, to flirt with wives who are feeling neglected in their relationships. His current seductive campaign is focused on Olivia, the spouse of a narcissistic billionaire, and the lady is responding quite nicely to the cream-colored missives he secretly leaves for her. So nicely, in fact, that Hughie decides to employ a similar technique&#x2014;and shockingly similar messages&#x2014;in his pursuit of his own heart�s desire: the aloof and charming lingerie designer, Leticia.

They fly into the enemy heartland through skies filled with MiG fighters, SAMs, and Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA). Losses are heavy and courage and heroism are commonplace. The stories also include accounts by a cross section of Wild Weasel associates without whose support the mission could not have been successfully performed including a contractor, Flight Surgeon, Chaplain Maintenance technician, and the wife of a pilot killed in action (KIA). Some are shot down and rescued, others captured or killed, and many successfully complete their missions. All wonder if there will be a tomorrow. The stories take place in peace and war. Many are thrilling accounts of combat action, some are funny, others tragic, all are interesting. It is a moving testament to all Wild Weasels and their families especially to those that paid the ultimate price with courage and honor.</p><p>Ed Rock flew two combat tours of duty during the Vietnam War as an F-105 Wild Weasel pilot and commanded two F-105 fighter squadrons with the Wild Weasel mission.

Exploring what is odd, eccentric, and unexpected in the Bard&#x2019;s plays and poems, these theorists highlight not only the many ways that Shakespeare can be queered but also the many ways that Shakespeare can enrich queer theory. This innovative anthology reveals an early modern playwright insistently returning to questions of language, identity, and temporality, themes central to contemporary queer theory. Since many of the contributors do not study early modern literature, <i>Shakesqueer </i>takes queer theory back and brings Shakespeare forward, challenging the chronological confinement of queer theory to the last two hundred years. The book also challenges conceptual certainties that have narrowly equated queerness with homosexuality. Chasing all manner of stray desires through every one of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays and poems, the contributors cross temporal, animal, theoretical, and sexual boundaries with abandon. Claiming adherence to no one school of thought, the essays consider <i>The Winter&#x2019;s Tale</i> alongside network TV, <i>Hamlet</i> in relation to the death drive, <i>King John</i> as a history of queer theory, and <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> in tune with a Sondheim musical. Together they expand the reach of queerness and queer critique across chronologies, methodologies, and bodies.<p></p><p><i>Contributors</i>.

She is the author of <i>Unhistorical Shakespeare: Queer Theory in Shakespearean Literature and Film</i> and <i>Wanton Words: Rhetoric and Sexuality in English Renaissance Drama</i>.</p>&#x201c;The adventurous essays in<i> Shakesqueer </i>demonstrate that queer theory does indeed need Shakespeare, if only to defy rumors of its own demise: the essays show what is vital about a queer studies that might have been thought by this point too domesticated or reified or &#x2018;fixed&#x2019; to be intellectually vibrant.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Carolyn Dinshaw</b>, author of <i>Getting Medieval: Sexualities and Communities, Pre- and Postmodern</i><br><br>&#x201c;What happens when queer theory gets into bed with Shakespeare? A play in forty-eight acts, this spirited group production never ceases to entertain and surprise with its queer cast of characters: virgins, eunuchs, and lechers; queens, kings, and pageboys; tyrants, assassins, and killjoys; lions, tigers, and bears&#x2014;oh my! Full of toil and trouble, wit and wisdom, <i>Shakesqueer</i> succeeds where few other edited collections do: it puts the play back in playwright, and the fun back in theory.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Diana Fuss</b>, Princeton University <br><br>&#x201c;In the end, this book is a big, glorious mess, full of playful juxtapositions and frightening possibilities.

Earl on earl analysis sits beside complex queer theories on the bard.&#x201d; (<i>Gay Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Few works of literary criticism deserve the descriptor &#x2018;monumental,&#x2019; but this one does. . . . The book is both readable and witty. It is also important, for it drives the final nail into the coffin of 20th-century Shakespearean studies. . . . No hierarchies survive this book. Every play and poem receives a fresh new reading. . . . Essential. All readers.&#x201d; (M. J. Emery <i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;If you're looking for clues to Romeo and Mercutio's secret romance in the new academic volume <i>Shakesqueer : A Queer Companion to the Complete Works of Shakespeare</i>, edited by Madhavi Menon (Duke), you're barking up the wrong yew tree. American University professor Menon and her queer-theorist contributors find queerness in Shakespeare in that term's most all-encompassing meaning of oddball, unusual, or non-normative. But when you come to think of it, fairy queen Titania falling in love with an ass named Bottom is pretty queer, in all senses of the word.&#x201d; (Roberto Friedman <i>Bay Area Reporter</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;It is rare to see a volume that does so much, and does it with such consistent wit, thoughtfulness, and creativity. . . . In putting together this volume, Menon has done scholars from all fields and periods an immense service. <i>Shakesqueer</i> gives us a very queer new reading &#x2018;&#x2019;companion&#x2019;&#x2019; &#x2014; friend, helpmeet, comrade-in-arms &#x2014; that makes us exquisitely aware of the need for the perverse and disruptive critical practice its essays so pleasurably model.&#x201d; (Melissa E. Sanchez <i>Renaissance Quarterly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something for every queer scholar and Bard-lover in the anthology; from bears in <i>Henry VIII</i> to eunuchs in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, from the death drive in <i>Hamlet</i> to precariously heterosexual marriages in <i>All&#x2019;s Well that Ends Well</i>, the contributing authors chart Shakespeare&#x2019;s varied engagements with queerness, putting pressure on assumptions that Shakespeare has nothing to offer to contemporary queer theory. . . . The assorted essays assert that Shakespeare has as much to offer queer theory as queer theory can contribute to understanding and deconstructing the Bard&#x2019;s texts. This book belongs on every bookish queer&#x2019;s shelf, right where the leather-bound <i>Complete Works of William Shakespeare</i> butts up against Butler and Foucault.&#x201d; (Kestryl Cael Lowrey <i>Lambda Literary Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This fascinating collection of essays explores the queer elements within all of Shakespeare&#x2019;s works.

On 14 October the double battle was fought: Napoleon with 96,000 men and 120 guns engaged and heavily defeated Prince Hohenlohe and General Ruchel. The decisive engagement was fought further north where Marshal Davout with 27,000 men and 40 guns routed the main Prussian army under Frederick William IV and the Duke of Brunswick.

While maintaining a strong biblical orientation, Schwarz draws on a wide range of resources, including philosophy and the natural sciences, in order to map out what it means to be human.<br><br>Schwarz's <i>Human Being</i> will interest anyone who is concerned with how in the face of fascinating scientific insights we can intelligently talk today about human sinfulness, human freedom, and human beings as children of the God who created us.</p><p>Hans Schwarz is Professor of Systematic Theology andContemporary Theological Issues at the University ofRegensburg, Germany.<b><i>Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies</i></b><br> "An ambitious, learned, and helpful study, particularly for those interested in addressing anthropological issues from a variety of disciplinary perspectives."<br><br><b>Alan G. Padgett</b><br> -- Luther Seminary<br> "With a teacher's wisdom and deep learning worn lightly, Hans Schwarz discusses biblical, theological, and scientific perspectives on human life. The Human Being is a wonderfully clear presentation of Christian theology, covering all the main points and never failing to present a contemporary perspective on what it means to be human."<br><br><b>J. Wentzel van Huyssteen</b><br> -- Princeton Theological Seminary<br> "This theological anthropology is a remarkable accomplishment.

Scholars and students will find this book a rich and exciting resource."<br><br><b>Ted Peters</b><br> -- Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary<br> "'Christians are Easter people living from and toward that Easter experience of a new creation,' Schwarz concludes.

Here one can purchase ritual items and raw materials for the fabrication of traditional charms, plus a variety of soaps, powders, and aromatic goods known in the trade as &#x201c;spiritual products.&#x201d; For those seeking health or success, love or protection, these potions offer the power of the saints and the authority of the African gods.<br>In Spiritual Merchants, Carolyn Morrow Long provides an inside look at the followers of African-based belief systems and the retailers and manufacturers who supply them. Traveling from New Orleans to New York, from Charleston to Los Angeles, she takes readers on a tour of these shops, examines the origins of the products, and profiles the merchants who sell them.<br>Long describes the principles by which charms are thought to operate, how ingredients are chosen, and the uses to which they are put. She then explores the commodification of traditional charms and the evolution of the spiritual products industry&#x2014;from small-scale mail order "doctors" and hoodoo drugstores to major manufacturers who market their products worldwide. She also offers an eye-opening look at how merchants who are not members of the culture entered the business through the manufacture of other goods such as toiletries, incense, and pharmaceuticals. Her narrative includes previously unpublished information on legendary Voodoo queens and hoodoo workers, as well as a case study of John the Conqueror root and its metamorphosis from spirit-embodying charm to commercial spiritual product.<br>No other book deals in such detail with both the history and current practices of African-based belief systems in the United States and the evolution of the spiritual products industry. For students of folklore or anyone intrigued by the world of charms and candle shops, Spiritual Merchants examines the confluence of African and European religion in the Americas and provides a colorful introduction to a vibrant aspect of contemporary culture.<br>The Author: Carolyn Morrow Long is a preservation specialist and conservator at the the Smithsonian Institution&#x2019;s National Museum of American History.<br></p><p>The Author: Carolyn Morrow Long is a preservation specialist and conservator at the the Smithsonian Institution&#x2019;s National Museum of American History.<br>From the Introduction: An outsider, passing through certain African American and Latino neighborhoods, begins to notice shops with names like Fulton Religious Supply, Seven Archangels Candle Shop, Bot�nica San Lazaro, Bot�nica Hijo de Chang�, House of Power, or Yerber�a Pancho Villa. Curious, the stranger enters. The interior is crammed from floor to ceiling with a bewildering array of merchandise, some recognizably Christian and some decidedly not. Statues of the saints come in every description, from life-sized images to plastic dashboard icons. The shelves are lined with bottles of bath-and-floor wash, soaps, oils, perfumes, lotions, bath crystals, sachets, sprinkling powders, floor sweeping compound, incense, aerosol sprays, and candles. Their colorful and evocative labels offer Strong Love, Domination, Peaceful Home, Money Jackpot, Get Away Evil, Court Case, High John the Conqueror, or Death unto My Enemy; they solicit the aid of St. Michael the Archangel, the Seven African Powers, or the Virgin of Guadalupe. Behind the counter are glass jars of dried leaves and flowers, sticks and twigs, brownish powders, twisted black tubers, and pale roots like tiny, shriveled human hands. The display case contains religious medals and holy cards, charm packets and animal bones. Racks exhibit books of prayers and psalms, dream interpretation, and magical formulae. Festoons of necklaces hang from hooks-red and white, red and black, green and black, blue and clear, yellow and amber, all white, and multicolored. There are conical cement heads with cowrie-shell mouths and eyes, chains adorned with miniature tools, wooden machetes, iron horseshoes, seashells, and silver and brass crowns. And among these seemingly exotic goods, one finds mundane items like laundry bluing, saltpeter, sulfur, lye, ammonia, turpentine, cleaning fluid, and rubbing alcohol. A hand-lettered sign announces that consultations are available. <p>This is the domain of the spiritual merchants, purveyors of health, attraction, control, success, protection, revenge, luck, the power of the saints, and the authority of the African gods. Their packaged wares, known in the trade as "spiritual products," are mass-produced renditions of the traditional spirit-embodying and spirit-directing charms used in the African-based New World belief systems. The businesses called religious stores or candle shops sell charm ingredients, occult books, and various manufactured potions oriented toward African American Voodoo and hoodoo. In the context of this book, Voodoo refers to the organized religion, closely related to Haitian Vodou, that flourished in New Orleans during the colonial period and into the nineteenth century and is now experiencing a revival. Hoodoo (called rootwork in the Georgia and South Carolina Low Country) denotes the magical practices of "workers" or "doctors" who serve individual clients. As many black Americans abandon such beliefs, hoodoo-oriented religious stores and candle shops are becoming rare. More common are the businesses known as bot�nicas, offering plants, products, and ritual paraphernalia to the followers of Santer�a, an Afro-Cuban religion practiced primarily by immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean. In the Southwest, similar stores called yerber�as stock the herbs and charms used in the Mexican systems of healing and sorcery called curanderismo and brujer�a, as well as Santer�a-oriented products that have been adopted by Mexican Americans.</p></p><h2>Angels in the Realms of Heaven: The Reality of Angelic Ministry Today (Dancing with Angels)</h2><p><p>Heaven is real! </p><p>Christ has already prepared a place for you to dwell with Him in Heaven.

A man shoos and poo-poos a couple of cooing "rats with wings," only to be confronted by a group of kids in pigeon costumes bearing interesting facts about the maligned birds. Through a series of panels and full spreads, readers learn that before the invention of airplanes, pigeons carried mail; that they are faster than a car; that they mate for life; and that they come in a wide variety of breeds, some of which are quite fancy, such as the Victoria Crowned, named for Queen Victoria. In a brief author's note, McCloskey explains that his painted, cartoon-style illustrations are done on pigeon blue Fabriano paper, the kind used by Pablo Picasso, an artist so enraptured by the birds that he named his daughter Paloma (the Spanish word for pigeon). Complementing the paintings are well-integrated reproductions of historic pigeon prints from the author's personal collection. Some facts are presented in a simple and straightforward manner ("When two pigeons make a family, that's called mating.... If a human picks the two pigeons to mate, that is called breeding."), while other tidbits, presented in speech bubbles, lend the title a more informal, humorous tone ("Picasso's dad kept pigeons...and young Pablo cleaned the poop in the coop.").

It&#39;s not just in the roads, aqueducts and settlements, though, that Rome&#39;s immense legacy can be found. Or even in more recent buildings from the Renaissance to the present day that have been constructed in a neoclassical style. We need only to look at modern law, which is based on principles developed during the Roman Empire. Or modern philosophy, which stands on the shoulders of work by Plato, Cicero and others. And although Latin may be a dead language, we still use it in scientific classification, even for newly coined words. From the death of Caesar to the Barbarian invasions centuries later, from Julius Caesar to Nero, from the deities to Christianity, and from the structure of political life to gladiatorial games, The Encyclopedia of the Ancient Roman Empire is an outstanding celebration of the glory that was Rome. Ranging from farming to military technology, from assassinations to the Visigoths sacking Rome, from Rome&#39;s Catacombs to Hadrian&#39;s Wall, the book expertly explores the history of Imperial Rome. Accessibly written and with a wealth of colour illustrations and photographs, The Encyclopedia of the Ancient Roman Empire is a fascinating reference work for any home.</p><p></p><h2>Dynamic Characters</h2><p><p>A truly unforgettable story is defined by its characters.

Nearly 20 percent of people live with a disability or mental health condition, which means so many families--maybe even yours--are dealing with these issues for their loved one. The one place everyone should feel like they belong is their house of worship and other faith-based community organizations. <em>From Longing to Belonging </em>is a new approach to inclusion. Author Shelly Christensen, M.A., a leader in faith community disability inclusion, provides step-by-step guidance to any faith-based organization committed to welcoming, supporting, and including people with disabilities or mental health conditions and those who love them. <em>From Longing to Belonging </em>will help your faith community take a new look at inclusion and belonging and learn how to welcome and include everyone.</p><p><em>From Longing to Belonging </em>is a comprehensive approach to inclusion of people with disabilities and mental health conditions written by one of the leading voices in the faith community disability inclusion movement. Based on Shelly Christensen's work with congregations and faith-based organizations, people with disabilities, mental health conditions, and families, this book guides churches, synagogues, and other houses of worship to take their good intentions and turn them into actions--so that each and every person can participate and contribute how they wish. Other faith-based organizations-including seminaries and university religious studies programs, social service agencies, community centers, youth groups, camps, arts venues, and philanthropic organizations-can advance services, supports, and participation by people with disabilities and mental health conditions. </p><p> </p><p>As Shelly Christensen was researching and framing <em>From Longing to Belonging</em>, she recalled the iconic text from Isaiah 56:7, "For my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples." Faith communities often quoted this text to let seekers in on how inclusive they were. But the truth is, this phrase only tells part of the story. </p><p>Shelly explored the whole text of Isaiah to 56:7. What she read astounded her. Here was the truest understanding of inclusion she'd ever seen--God's definition of what it means to belong and be included. <em>"I will bring them to My holy mount, and I will cause them to rejoice in My house of prayer, their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be acceptable upon My altar, for My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples."</em></p><p>Based on this text, Shelly developed a process that goes well beyond what faith communities are currently doing to build a true culture of belonging and inclusion.</p><p> </p><p>Shellly has developed and written about<em> a new approach</em> based on her experiences helping many different faith-based organizations. She gives us an understanding of what the terms "inclusion," and "belonging" mean through the stories she tells, including her own as the parent of a child with an autism spectrum disorder.</p><p>The book covers many aspects of inclusion in faith communities and religious organizations, including worship, social inclusion, religious education from preschool through adulthood, camping, youth groups, life cycle events, parenting, and grief and loss.</p><p>This book<em> </em>is based on two concepts, both equally important in a faith community's journey-The Spirit of Belonging and The Structure of Inclusion.</p></p><p>Shelly Christensen, MA, FAAIDD is an award-winning international author, speaker, consultant, and leader in the field of faith community inclusion of people with disabilities and mental health conditions. For nearly two decades Shelly has walked with diverse congregations and faith-based organizations to guide and inspire them to support belonging and inclusion in all aspects of community life.<p>"Drawn from her years of experience as a mother, a parent, an advocate, a program developer, a collaborator, a partner, and a leader, Shelly Christensen asks us to examine our feelings and experiences of belonging to our own faith communities.</p><p>What follows is an organized guide to what Shelly has learned, sometimes the hard way, from her own work and that of many others.</p><p> </p><p>The stories that Shelly tells, and the empowering paths she proposes to get to the place and time where you have your own, are what belonging is about. Enjoy the trip!"</p><p> </p><p>Bill Gaventa, M.Div.</p><p>Director, Summer Institute on Theology and Disability</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Shelly Christensen has created an invaluable "how to" guide for faith communities with <em>From Longing to Belonging.</em> The book speaks to the personal challenges and possibilities of a parent of a child with disabilities and how that translated into a call to action for faith communities. Shelly outlines the need for advocacy, empathy, and resilience. as she speaks to individuals and faith communities as to the necessity of making one's house of prayer for "all people." The book stands on a powerful faith based foundation that, key to all people is the basic need to belong and feel valued, just because they exist. <em>From Longing to Belonging</em> is an essential tool for clergy and laity who wish to spread wide their tent of meeting.</p><p>Rabbi Richard F. Address, D.Min</p><p>Director: Jewish Sacred Aging(R)</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In <em>From Longing to Belonging</em>, Shelly Christensen provides a comprehensive resource for understanding and developing successful inclusive efforts in faith communities. Drawing on her extensive personal and professional experience in the disability field, Shelly breaks down the components of both the "why" and the "how" of successful inclusion efforts, giving faith communities a path to developing congregations that are more than a place to be included, but a place to belong.</p><p>I have no doubt that <em>From Longing to Belonging </em>will quickly become a "go to" resource for faith communities looking to begin or develop inclusion efforts. It will certainly be one of the first that I recommend to congregations that seek consultation and support from our organization.</p><p>Karen Jackson</p><p>Executive Director</p><p>Faith Inclusion Network of Hampton Roads</p><p>Author, Loving Samantha</p></p><h2>Unexplained Mysteries of World War II</h2><p><p>Having searched through stacks of periodicals, military reports, interviews, and other publications, author William Breuer has discovered over one hundred such illogical events, and presents them in <i>Unexplained Mysteries of World War II</i>.<br><br> From popular mysteries to barely believable happenings, Breuer sheds light on the absurdity of war from a different angle.

But war is also a breeding ground for illogical occurrences, coincidences, premonitions, mysteries and twists of fate. Over 100 of these events are detailed here.This is the first comprehensive book on the intriguing arena of the mysterious, baffling, and oddly coincidental events during World War II. No other book looks at these fascinating unexplainable occurrences, which are recounted vividly and dramatically.

It is profoundly inspiring and at the same time, extremely practical.&#x201d;&#x2014;from the foreword by Jon Kabat-Zinn <br><br>&#x201c;Elana Rosenbaum wears gravity well. The maelstrom of cancer has swept her far beneath the waves and she has arisen repeatedly in celebration of life! Because of this, her buoyancy is trustworthy, wise, and delightfully light. Through story, poetry, unflinching transparency, and dozens of simple, straightforward awareness exercises she helps us hold ourselves more kindly, see ourselves more clearly, and discover our inborn capacity to wade into the great sea of uncertainty with curiosity and ease. Filled with gusto, grit, and gladness, this generous book is a guide and manifesto celebrating the possibility of feeling greater freedom in the midst of adversity, illness, and the everyday challenge of being a human being no matter what our condition.&#x201d;&#x2014;Saki Santorelli, EdD, MA, Executive Director, Center for Mindfulness in Medicine <br><br>&#x201c;Written out of the experience of her own cancer and stem cell transplant, where, as she says, &#x2018;anything can happen, including death,&#x2019; Elana Rosenbaum&#x2019;s wonderful book shows how serious illness forces us to &#x2018;drop the script&#x2019; and find inspiration in the present moment, even in (especially in) the moment where fear is unavoidable. This is an important book for all affected by serious and life-threatening illness, for families and friends.&nbsp; Every page has something precious to savor, born from long years of mindfulness practice and teaching at UMass, the home of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Elana is never prescriptive: she does not tell us what to think or what to do.Yet she shows how to remain open to new possibilities in the face of what we most fear, and how the illness itself can become a wellspring of heartfulness and healing. She shows how mindfulness is not an alternative to medicine, but integrates with it at every stage; that defining ourselves not by our illness but by our intrinsic worth nourishes a courage that we might never have thought possible.&#x201d;&#x2014;Mark Williams, author of<i> Mindfulness: Finding Peace in a Frantic World</i> <br><br>&#x201c;Elana Rosenbaum has provided a simple-to-follow roadmap to guide those with serious illness to achieve a high level of comfort to living in the moment. This book is ideal for those in need as well as their supporters.&#x201d;&#x2014;Arnold S. Freedman MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School <br><br>&#x201c;Occasionally there is a book that can make a real difference in a person&#x2019;s life. <i>Being Well </i>is one of those books. Anyone living with serious illness will find comfort, direction, solace, and hope in its pages. It offers a practical road map to mindful living and living well, even in very difficult circumstances. Ms. Rosenbaum shares her personal experiences with cancer as well as those of many patients whom she has helped find balance and repose. I will be recommending it to my patients and including some of her techniques in my own meditations.&#x201d;&#x2014;Hester Hill Schnipper, LICSW,&nbsp; author of&nbsp;<i> After Breast Cancer: A Common-Sense Guide to Life After Treatment</i>, and a two-time cancer survivor</p><h2>Run Gently Out There: Trials, trails, and tribulations of running ultramarathons</h2><p><p><b>If on leaving a trailhead, you only glance at your watch to have an idea of when you need to be back</b>, parts of this book will be for you.</p> <p><b>If when crossing a desert valley, you wonder what it is like to run in the silence and solitude way out there</b>, parts of this book will be for you.</p> <p><b>If wading across a beaver pond during a run seemed the only logical thing to do</b>, parts of this book will be for you.</p> <p><b>If you ever thought of running fifty miles in one day</b>, parts of this book will be for you.</p> <p><b>If you sometimes went out after sunset for a run because you saw a cloudless sky and you wanted to run under a visible night sky</b>, parts of this book will be for you.</p> <p><b>If you need to be out there where running with pauses continues to be just as important as the occasional run with the stopwatch on</b>, then <b><i>Run Gently Out There</i></b> is for you.</p> <p>Go along with the author as he takes you on a run that is not about anyone in particular, rather it is about what makes running trails and ultramarathons become a love affair with being out there and how running becomes part of a way of living.</p></p><p>Widely unacclaimed as a writer, bearer of bad jokes, and possessing a poor memory for what went wrong last time, John Morelock is currently an almost retired whale spotter, mirage analyst, baker, wool gatherer, maintainer of trails, and nature lecturer. Morelock took up running on August 17, 1984 at 4:33 in the afternoon and completed his first ultramarathon in January of 1986. He has long since completed several more ultramarathons; most of them in the Pacific Northwest, but also in places as diverse as Texas, Colorado, Tennessee, and Arkansas. He established his trail running credentials early by successfully returning to the trailhead where he had left the car on many training runs in the Olympic and Cascade Mountains. Although largely unfocused as a racer, he managed a victory in each of his first two decades of running, one at the 100-kilometer distance and one at the more standard 34.5-mile venue. In 2002 he noted that his total running miles had reached 50,027. Having accomplished this feat without once kicking or tripping over a porcupine he reasoned that it was a good point at which to quit tracking such things and made no more log entries. Now, with time slipping by, philosophical meandering and trailside distractions have led to less racing and more running with pauses. He lives on Whidbey Island in Washington state enjoying the trails with his wife, Kathy, who took him on a different ultraventure in 2004; a 600ish mile pilgrimage across Spain during which he once helped the nuns in Le�n, Spain bake the morning&#39;s bread--a wonderful day in Le�n before continuing westerly on the way to Santiago.</p><h2>Malinche&#39;s Conquest</h2><p>Malinche was the Amerindian translator for Hern�n Cort�s&#x2014;from her lips came the words that triggered the downfall of the great Aztec Emperor Moctezuma in the Spanish Conquest of 1521. In Mexico, Malinche&#x2019;s name is synonymous with &#x201c;traitor,&#x201d; yet folklore and legend still celebrate her mystique. The author traverses Mexico and delves into the country&#x2019;s extraordinary past to excavate the mythologies of this exceptional woman&#x2019;s life. Malinche&#x2014;abandoned to strangers as a slave when just a girl&#x2014;was taken by Cort�s to become interpreter, concubine, witness to his campaigns, mother to his son, yet married to another. She survived unimaginably precarious times relying on her intelligence, courage, and gift for language. Though Malinche&#x2019;s words changed history, her own story remained untold, until now.</p><p><b>Anna Lanyon</b> is a Spanish teacher and translator.<br>An imaginative, vivid reconstruction of a Mexican Indian woman who profoundly shaped New World history--and then was reviled for four centuries.La Malinche, as she is known in Mexico, was probably 18 or 19 when Spanish soldiers first landed near Veracruz in 1519. A Mayan speaker who also knew Nahuatl, and who was thus conversant with various peoples of central Mexico, Malinche (whom the Spanish called Marina) guided the conquistadors to Tenochtitlan and negotiated their entrance into the capital of the people erroneously known to us as Aztecs. (One of the many contributions of Lanyon's study is that it restores the name Culua-Mexica to Moctezuma's people; Azteca, she writes, was an archaic and obsolete term that crept into a Spanish report and was repeated uncritically ever since.) After Cortes and his soldiers overthrew the regal government of Moctezuma and Cuahtemoc and established Spanish rule over Mexico, Malinche was put to other uses than as an interpreter; in fact, she bore a child to Cortes, one of the first mestizos born (that child, named Martin, has since been apotheosized as the founder of the cosmic race of Mexicans). She died around March 1528, probably in one of the great and horrifying plagues that were sweeping Mexico at the time, and was buried in an unmarked grave. Australian historian Lanyon has done her homework well to resurrect Malinche from the ashes of history and to restore her reputation, for she has been viewed for nearly 500 years as a traitor who delivered Mexico into enemy hands. Lanyon also defends Malinche from the ridiculous charge, propounded in Gary Jennings's novel Aztec and many other books, that she was a promiscuous vixen in beads and buckskin, something that contemporary Spanish reporters such as Bernal Diaz, who was an ardent gossip, would certainly have noted.Lanyon's well-written life of Malinche will be of much interest to historians and general readers alike. -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

"Runs in the family, cousin."<br><br>Since they both stood a hair over six feet, they were able to exchange a quick hug over the bar, and Kevin thumped him on the back. "Damn glad you made it home."<br><br>"Me, too." Sean sat on the bar stool and took a long swig of the foamy beer Kevin put in front of him. "Sorry I missed your wedding. And Joe's, too."<br><br>"You were getting your ass shot at in Afghanistan. We won't hold it against you. Much."<br><br>"Still can't believe you both found women willing to be your Mrs. Kowalskis. What's wrong with them?"<br><br>Kevin flashed him a grin. "It's the dimples, man. Women can't resist them. Too bad for you we got 'em from Ma and all you got are the blue eyes from the old man's side."<br><br>"They do me well enough. How are your parents doing?"<br><br>"Good. They're looking forward to seeing you, and Ma made lasagna for tonight."<br><br>Sean grinned and patted his stomach. "I didn't stop for lunch, so I've got plenty of room. There are a lot of things I miss about my mother, God rest her soul, but her cooking isn't one of them. Aunt Mary, though? Damn, that woman can put a meal together."<br><br>Kevin nodded, then stepped away for a minute to grab a water. "So, you've got no job. Gonna mooch food from Ma and bum an apartment from me. The army was supposed to make you a man, not a useless son of a bitch."<br><br>"Twelve years was enough. Don't know what I want to do now, but I know it's not more of that."<br><br>"No interest in going back to Maine and helping your brother run the lodge?"<br><br>Sean shrugged. It had come up&#x2014;especially when he'd told his brothers and sister he was going to hang out with the New Hampshire branch of the family for a while. But spending the rest of his life at the Northern Star Lodge wasn't something he wanted to do. As a child, he'd hated strangers making themselves at home in his house, and he'd never outgrown it. He just wasn't cut out to be an innkeeper.<br><br>"It's a plan B," he said.<br><br>Kevin took a swig off the water bottle, then screwed the cap back on. "You know I'm just giving you shit. You can crash here as long as you want."<br><br>"Appreciate it. Once I've had my fill of Aunt Mary's cooking, I might go home or...hell if I know." It was one of the reasons he'd decided to leave the army. There was nowhere he had to be tomorrow. Or the day after that.<br><br>A tall, busty redhead stepped out from a back room and Kevin waved her over. "This is my cousin Sean. Sean, this is Paulie Reed, my head bartender, assistant manager and all-around right-hand man. Woman. Person. Right-hand person."<br><br>"Nice to meet you," Sean said, shaking her hand. She had one hell of a grip.<br><br>"I've heard a lot about you. Welcome home. My fiance, Sam, and I live in the apartment below yours, so give a shout if you need anything."<br><br>"Will do." He watched her walk away because she had a hell of a swing, but&#x2014;whether it was the mention of a fiance or the fact she just wasn't his type&#x2014;it didn't do much for him. "Jasper's Bar &amp; Grille, huh? Interesting name."<br><br>"It came with the place and I'm too cheap to buy a new sign. Finish that beer and I'll take you upstairs now that Paulie's off break."<br><br>Sean knocked back the rest of the suds and picked up his duffel. He followed his cousin to a back hallway, then up two flights of stairs to the apartment Kevin was letting him use for the duration of his visit. It was a decent place and clean, with an oversize leather couch and a big-screen TV. All good, as far as he was concerned.<br><br>"So this is it," Kevin told him when he was done showing him around and had given him the key. "You've got all our numbers, and Paulie's usually in the bar if you need anything."<br><br>Sean shook his hand. "See you at dinner, then. Looking forward to meeting Beth and that baby girl of yours."<br><br>"Lily's a firecracker. Had her first birthday a week ago and loves terrorizing the shit out of her cousins." He whipped out his wallet, and it fell open to a picture of a feisty-looking little girl with one of those palm-tree-ponytail things on the top of her head, bright blue eyes and devilish dimples.<br><br>"She'll break some hearts someday," Sean said, because that's what men seemed to say when shown pictures of other guys' daughters.<br><br>"And I'll break open some heads. Joe's Brianna looks a lot like Lily, but without the dimples. She's four and a half months now and loud as hell." Kevin headed for the door. "I told Beth I'd be home by three so she can make something to bring to Ma's without tripping over Lily, who doesn't stay where we put her anymore. I'll see you about six."<br><br>When he was gone, Sean dropped onto the couch and closed his eyes. It was good to be home, even if home was a borrowed apartment. For the first time in twelve years he could go wherever he wanted. Do whatever he wanted. The army had given him a good start in life and he didn't regret the years he'd served, but he was ready to be his own man again.<br><br>The first order of business as his own man? A power nap.<br><br>A knock at the door surprised him, jerking him out of a light sleep. It wasn't as if he was expecting company. As far as he knew, the only people who'd be looking for him were family, and he was meeting them at his aunt and uncle's. Still, he pulled open the door expecting to see one of his cousins.<br><br>He was wrong. His unexpected guest was definitely <em>not</em> related to him, which was a good thing considering his body reacted as though it was his first time seeing a pretty woman. She had a big curly mass of dark hair full of different colors&#x2014;almost like a deep cherrywood grain&#x2014;and whether she'd be a brunette or a redhead probably depended on the lighting. Her eyes were even darker, the color of strong black coffee, and just the right amount of curves softened a taller-than-average, lean body.<br><br>A body that made his body stand up and take notice in a way the sexy bartender downstairs hadn't. This woman wasn't too top-heavy and the way she took care of her body made him think if they wrestled under the sheets, she'd make it one hell of a good match.<br><br>Okay, he really needed to get laid if he was going to start imagining sex with any random stranger who knocked on his door.<br><br>"Can I help you?" he prompted when she just stood there and looked at him.<br><br>She picked at the fraying wrist of a navy sweatshirt that had Landscaping by Emma written across the front in fancy letters. "Are you Sean Kowalski?"<br><br>"Yup."<br><br>"I'm Emma Shaw...your fake fianc�e."<br><br>"Say what?"<br><br>Emma Shaw sure knew how to pick a fake man. The real Sean Kowalski was tall, had tanned and rugged arms stretching the sleeves of his blue T-shirt, and dark blond hair that looked as if it was growing out from a short cut. A little scruff covered his square jaw, as if he'd forgotten to shave for a couple of days, and even squinting at her in a suspicious manner, his eyes were the prettiest shade of blue she'd ever seen.<br><br>Okay, maybe it wasn't all suspicion. His expression implied he was afraid she was some crazy woman who'd gone off her meds and was going to start speaking in tongues or show him the handmade Sean doll she'd crafted to sleep with.<br><br>"Lady, I've never had a fianc�e, fake or otherwise," he said in a low voice that made her knees weaken just a little. "And it's been a while since I've gone on a decent bender, so if I'd asked you to marry me, I'm pretty sure I'd at least remember your face."<br><br>That would have been hard to do. "We've never actually met."<br><br>He stopped squinting at her and snorted. "Let me guess&#x2014;this is some joke my cousins thought would be a funny way to welcome me home? Okay, so...ha-ha. I've got stuff to do now."<br><br>He started to close the door, but she slapped her hand against it. "I'm a friend of Lisa's. Your cousin-in-law, I guess she'd be."<br><br>"Mikey's wife?" He pulled the door open when she nodded. "Maybe we should start this conversation in a different place. Like the beginning."<br><br>She took a deep breath, then blew it out. "My grandmother's raised me since I was four."<br><br>"Maybe not <em>that</em> far back."<br><br>"She retired to Florida a couple years ago with some friends, and I take care of the house I grew up in. But all she was doing was worrying about me, and when she started talking about moving back so I wouldn't be alone, I told her I had a boyfriend. Then I told her he'd moved in with me. And, because I would only date a super-great guy, after a while he proposed and naturally I accepted."<br><br>"And I got dragged into this how?"<br><br>"I had just gotten home from having lunch with Lisa and she'd mentioned sending you a care package. Your name just popped into my head when Gram asked what my boyfriend's name was."<br><br>He shook his head. "Let me get this straight. You told your grandmother that a guy you've never met is your boyfriend?"<br><br>"I just wanted her to worry less."<br><br>"Maybe she's right to worry about you."<br><br>Ouch. "I'm not crazy, you know."<br><br>He folded his arms across his chest and looked down at her. "You made up an imaginary boyfriend."<br><br>"You're not imaginary. Just uninformed."<br><br>He didn't even crack a smile. "What do you want from me?"<br><br></p><h2>The Taylor Guitar Book: 40 Years of Great American Flattops</h2><p>Growing from a small custom shop in the early 1970s to the only new brand to have challenged the traditional Big Three of American acoustic guitars (Gibson, Guild, and Martin), Taylor has effectively changed the marketplace for acoustic steel-string guitars and influenced every other maker of acoustic stringed instruments.<br><br>But Taylor's influence in the guitar market goes far beyond the guitars themselves.

The novel provides a vision of British childhood in the 1960s, a childhood caught between two cultures, each on the brink of enormous change.</p><p>Meera Syal is a writer, actress, playwright, comic and novelist. She wrote the screenplays for the films Bhaji on the Beach and the multi-award-winning My Sister Wife. Anita and Me, her first novel, won a Betty Trask Award and was shortlisted for the Guardian Fiction Prize. Her second novel, Life Isn&#39;t All Ha-Ha, Hee-Hee, was published in 1999.Nine-year-old Meena Kumar's cheeky narrative of her life as the only Punjabi girl in a small English village unfolds through wonderfully evocative description. Tollington, a once-thriving Midlands mining village, is, in the early '70s, on the decline. When the mines shut down, the men are idled while the town's suddenly assertive women form the Ballbearings Committee, a name to designate their employment at the local factory (among other things). A highway threatens to take away part of the village, the grammar school is closing down, skinheads are beginning to loiter in the kiddie park, and suburban sprawl is inching closer. These ominous changes form the background of the inventive Meena's life. She is alternately amused and embarrassed by her family and idolizes the roughest, brassiest girl in town, Anita Rutter. Meena is, much to her parents' chagrin, no angel: She lies, commits minor thefts, and has the bad habit of making vulgar remarks when her prim and proper aunties are around. Each small incident that Meena tells about leads to an arsenal of vividly described related anecdotes before the linear narrative is finally regained, a process that forms an endearing, richly three- dimensional picture of Meena and her family. Meanwhile, the story of the girl's relationship with Anita nicely illuminates the difficult, unspoken politics of childhood friendship. The two girls lead a gang, bully others, and engage in exuberant antics even though, in an increasingly poor and tense England, there is always an ominous undercurrent to events. Anita's black poodle is named ``Nigger,'' a local Indian bank manager is the victim of a racial attack, and Meena's secret love becomes a boot-stomping skinhead. Meena's loss of innocence, and her recognition of her heritage, coincides with her realization that her seemingly harmonious village also harbors violence, hatred, and fear. Syal handles all of this with an expert hand.

You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough. Prisons are built with stones of Law, brothels with bricks of Religion. Prudence is a rich, ugly old maid courted by Incapacity. Exuberance is Beauty. &#39;A superb insight into Blake&#39;s beliefs and essential for a full understanding of &#39;The Songs of Innocence and Experience.&#39;</p><p><b>Michael</b><b> Phillips </b>is a reader in the Department of English and Related Literature, University of York. He is also the author of <i>William Blake</i>: <i>The Creation of the Songs, from Manuscript to Illuminated Printing</i>.&#x201c;A leading American Blake scholar once described the prospect of editing <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> as &#x2018;a swamp filled with gators;&#x2019; Michael Phillips has navigated his way with great skill through the problems of chronology, textual unity, technique, contemporary context and significance of Blake's strikingly witty, sardonic, quirky, cryptic product of his unique combination of text and illustration in his illuminated books. As well as the facsimile of Copy B, one of the earliest of the nine known copies of the book, there are twenty-one valuable supplementary color plates of comparable pages from other copies, including a full run of Plate 14 as it occurs in the nine copies produced between 1793 to the year of his death, 1827. The detailed commentary discusses both text and illustrations, and in the case of the illustrations is most helpfully accompanied by appropriate details from Blake's designs.&#x201d; &#x2014; Martin Butlin, formerly Keeper of the British Collection, Tate Gallery, London, editor of the catalogue raisonne of the Complete Paintings and Drawings of William Blake<br><br> (Martin Butlin)<br><br>&#x201c;This edition of one of Blake&#x2019;s most potent and provocative books will give great pleasure both to Blake enthusiasts and to those new to his work.&#x201d;<br><br> (Tracy Chevalier)<br><br>&#x201c;This is an excellent scholarly edition of one of Blake&#x2019;s most fascinating works, likely to become the defining text for generations to come. No one knows as much about Blake&#x2019;s work in this period as Michael Phillips and he uses his knowledge of the text, its context, and Blake&#x2019;s printing techniques to open up the question of what Blake thought he was doing with <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>.&#x201d; &#x2014;John Mee<br><br> (John Mee)</p><h2>The Best Kind of People: A Novel</h2><p><b>A local schoolteacher is arrested, leaving his family to wrestle with the possibility of his guilt, in this exquisite novel about loyalty, truth, and happiness.</b><br><br> The Woodburys cherish life in the affluent, bucolic suburb of Avalon Hills, Connecticut.

It was a white wooden structure with turquoise trim, both colors frayed and chipped around the edges, on the shore of Woodbury Lake in rural Connecticut. Jimmy had a small tattoo of her name in an Old English gangster--style font cupping his right pectoral muscle, a secret hovering underneath his crisp school uniform shirt and blazer. She had gripped his sweaty hand in the tattoo shop in Boston when they&#x2019;d stolen away for an hour on class trip day. He&#x2019;d peeled back the bloody gauze on the bus afterwards, kids crowding around in quiet awe. A lot of students in their class had tattoos&#x2014;-including a girl whose entire back was covered in a passage from a Father John Misty song&#x2014;-but no one had proclaimed his devotion to a girlfriend so permanently before. Sadie thought that she&#x2019;d get his initials tattooed sometime, maybe inside a tiny illustrated heart. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t handle the pain,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say, but it was the permanence that felt dizzying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His watch beeped midnight as she pressed his wrists to the tarp that separated their bodies from the splintery floorboards. Her long brown hair formed a tent around his face, which smelled of sixty--proof sunscreen, an organic brand redolent of almonds. Sometimes she rubbed it on her hands to smell during the day when he wasn&#x2019;t around. She made a birthday wish for continued academic success while pressing both thumbs to his radial arteries. She knew that if he had a wish, it would be to stay with Sadie forever, to suspend time so that there would be only her and him. She was a Virgo, and therefore infinitely more practical.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She curled her toes, pulled away, her lips bruised and pillowed from kissing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Wanna?&#x201d; He wrestled his arms away from her grasp and cupped both hands around her ass and squeezed, pulling her even closer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Swim first,&#x201d; she said, sitting up but still straddling him. &#x201c;The lake is so still right now, it&#x2019;s the best time.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Outside, the September air aped mid--July heat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jimmy pulled her in for a pre--swim kiss and sang &#x201c;Happy Birthday&#x201d; into her mouth. They could hear the slight waves under the boathouse, occasionally a dog barking across the lake. Sex was a relatively new thing. An amazing thing. The primary reason for hanging out in the otherwise damp and spider--filled world of the Woodbury family boathouse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A raccoon they&#x2019;d nicknamed Conan O&#x2019;Brien wobbled across the roof and pushed his face against the screened--in skylight, pawing at a rip in the seam. He had a distinct patch of reddish fur above his eyes. Sadie turned towards the noise to lie beside her boyfriend, pinning her shoulder blades to the floor. The boathouse ceiling peaked in an A--frame and was jammed with Woodbury family detritus going back to the 1970s. Between the rafters: yellowed life jackets, canoe paddles, a rusty--handled tricycle, deflated water toys, and decaying file boxes labelled with words like <i>1997 Taxes</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;He wants to celebrate your birthday,&#x201d; Jimmy said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;He just loves an audience.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They&#x2019;d been back at school for one week. Their senior year in high school at Avalon prep had begun with aplomb. They were both in the accelerated stream, their sights set on prestigious universities, afternoons filled with student government meetings, sporting events, community volunteer hours, making out between the rows of woody ancient texts in the school library. The week had been busy and thus ordinary. This was the last weekend that anything would feel normal until they were halfway through college.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Conan sat by the ancient weather vane atop the boathouse, watching as the couple peeled off their simple tanks and cutoff shorts. They ran naked out onto the dock, launching knees to chests in cannonballs, breaking up the swarms of night insects circling the lake in a uniform frenzy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sadie thought about how her body would pop up with a force equal to the weight of the water that was displaced, something her father taught her as a child that she found hard to grasp while it was happening. Her body cooled instantly. She launched forward into the darkness, a swim of pure muscle memory, with Jimmy in pursuit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They reached the floating dock near the middle of the lake, clambering up the ladder slick with wet moss. They sat with their knees touching under the full moon, Sadie twisting the lake water from her hair and then retying it with the elastic band around her wrist. She crossed her arms over her breasts. Jimmy reached under her elbow to touch her right nipple.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you know that dog bites are twice as common on a night when there&#x2019;s a full moon?&#x201d; she asked, pulling him towards her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that a fact?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Anecdotally,&#x201d; she said. Their lips were almost touching. She ran her hand along his jaw, feeling the faint stubble. &#x201c;My mom noticed it at the hospital. Every full moon, a few dog bites. Then she found a study that confirmed it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jimmy lifted her breast to his mouth. Could they have sex on the floating dock without being seen or heard? She moaned, cupping one hand around his head. A dog barked again across the lake. Doubtful. They pulled apart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Eglington,&#x201d; Sadie said, giggling. He was always on his deck with the binoculars. Jimmy nodded, thankful for the darkness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sadie picked at the scab on her knee that had dried in the shape of Florida. A chunk of Key West broke free under her nail.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>���</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Woodbury house was dark except for two glowing squares of kitchen light. A quarter of the way around the lake, at Sadie&#x2019;s best friend Amanda&#x2019;s house, Carter the family dog continued to bark ceaselessly as a police car pulled into the driveway. The red and blue lights blinkered in a lazy swirl. Sadie and Jimmy stared as though they would be able to tell just by looking why the cops were there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s weird,&#x201d; Jimmy said. &#x201c;Should we swim over?&#x201d; He dipped a toe into the still water.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nah, it&#x2019;s late. Let&#x2019;s just call her when we get back.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jimmy curled up into a ball and somersaulted back into the lake. Sadie watched him tread water for a moment and then followed. When they reached the shore, they pulled on their clothes on the strip of rocky beach. Conan gripped the bark of the largest oak tree, shimmying upwards, teeth tearing a sheaf of moldy paper from <i>1997 Taxes,</i> green eyes aglow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Joan was drying the last dinner plate, about to go wrap Sadie&#x2019;s birthday presents, but her husband, George, took the dishtowel from her hand and replaced it with a glass of red wine. She took a sip, turned back to the expansive bay window, trying to make sure Jimmy and Sadie were not in any trouble. She hated when they swam at night. She would get flashbacks of a teenaged girl she&#x2019;d worked on at the hospital who had drowned and come back to life but remained essentially brain--dead. The image would be of the girl&#x2019;s cold arm hanging off the gurney as she was wheeled down the hall at the trauma center.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>George kissed her cheek. &#x201c;Come sit down, the kids are fine. Remember those nine hundred years of swimming lessons? Those ceremonies with the badges?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I should go check on them anyway,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>George gave her an affectionate squeeze. &#x201c;The water is so calm right now. They&#x2019;re okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She joined him at the table, placing an open Tupperware of lemon squares between them. She looked at the wine, tilted her glass in his direction in a gesture of <i>what&#x2019;s up?</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Marriage is so much about embedded routines. That night they&#x2019;d had grilled salmon and rice noodles, saut�ed greens. The same as every Sunday night. Usually George was watching the news by now, head leaned back and mouth agape with a slow, murmuring snore. Joan glanced towards the window again, unable to stop herself from getting up and leaning over the sink on her tiptoes, pressing her forehead against the glass. All she was able to see in the moonlight was a dark blur of water beyond the edge of the hill, and the tip of the long wooden dock. George made a whirring sound and a helicopter motion with his hand, gently mocking her overprotective nature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Joan surrendered with a laugh and sat back down. George raised his glass in a cheers, and pulled at the side of his lips before speaking. &#x201c;Honey, for weeks I&#x2019;ve been receiving these cryptic messages in my office mailbox,&#x201d; he said, handing her two scraps of torn loose--leaf paper, both folded in half, that he&#x2019;d pulled from his blazer pocket. One read <i>People Are Watching You,</i> and the other <i>Be Careful</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Teenaged nonsense.&#x201d; She sipped her wine, swirled it around, and set it back on the table. She was excited to see Sadie open her presents in the morning at breakfast.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Or so I thought, but today Dorothy told me to call a lawyer. She knows everything, working in the front office all day long, of course. She said there&#x2019;s a rumor <i>you&#x2019;re being set up.</i> It was all so Hollywood movie&#x2013;-sounding that I laughed at her. But she looked deadly serious. She wouldn&#x2019;t tell me anything else. Dorothy was acting strange&#x2014;-stranger than normal, anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s such a nutbar, Dorothy. Set up for what? Did you believe her?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dorothy McKnight was the secretary, and she irritated both of them, especially at parties, always wanting to talk about conspiracy theories and how Barack Obama was a Muslim.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So I called Bennie during my spare this afternoon&#x2014;-he&#x2019;s the eldest son of my father&#x2019;s lawyer. You know, they&#x2019;re always at our Christmas parties?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t he a kid?&#x201d; asked Joan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No, he&#x2019;s forty, if you can believe it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I called him again tonight. I&#x2019;m on edge, Joan. I just wanted to tell you this. I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s happening.&#x201d; He took another generous sip of wine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;A practical joke? It&#x2019;s so strange.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>George shook his head. &#x201c;I really don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; This was a phrase George&#x2014;-learned, stoic, opinionated&#x2014;-rarely used. He prided himself on knowing the things that mattered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sadie and Jimmy jogged up the dirt path, wet bare feet on the stones between the bramble that curled into the sloping backyard. They were breathless when they reached the plateau, pausing where a row of kale and lettuces grew, waiting to be culled on her mother&#x2019;s gardening day the following weekend. The rectangular in--ground pool that bordered their back deck made its usual hum of white noise. A circular hot tub, currently on the fritz, faced out onto the lake, edging out over the sharp lip of the hill. Ornate gardens sculpted carefully to appear wild surrounded the pool. Sadie leaned down and rubbed some lavender between her palms, cupping her hands around her face to inhale the warm scent on her way to the side entrance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They snuck up the back stairs, rubbing their wet heads on the threadbare sunburst swim towels hanging from the coat hooks by the door to the basement. Jimmy traced a finger along Sadie&#x2019;s spine, causing her to pause, shiver, and bat his hand away before she stepped over Payton, the fat sleeping tomcat on his designated fourth--step nap space. She headed for the kitchen barefoot, in search of iced tea. The plan to sneak up to Sadie&#x2019;s room and finish what they had started was immediately thwarted by the unusual presence of her parents, seated at either end of the kitchen table.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Woodbury parents were the academic sort, floating brains in denial of the body. Sadie reasoned that it was better not to talk about sex with them, to ensure that both she and her parents retained the privacy they both needed. It was less denial, she reasoned, more maturity. The same way that they all went to church on Sundays but never talked about God. Some things were meant to stay inside our own heads. When Jimmy stayed over, she was never sure if they knew or not. She did know that neither party was eager to discuss it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When they entered the kitchen, the adults reacted with a sudden and uncharacteristic silence. Her mother&#x2019;s brownish--gray bob was pushed back behind her ears with the help of her glasses. Joan usually had two facial expressions&#x2014;-tired from work or happy to have a day off. Her face betrayed a sense of resigned incredulity. She never drank after dinner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up with you guys? You&#x2019;re not usually up this late.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; Joan said, in a way that sounded the opposite. She picked up the container of lemon squares and held them out to Jimmy, who put a whole one in his mouth and grabbed a second, grinning appreciatively while he chewed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s past midnight&nbsp;. . .&#x201d; Sadie sing--songed expectantly. Joan stared at her daughter for a few moments before realizing what she meant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, happy birthday, darling!&#x201d; Joan said, half present.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, happy birthday, beautiful daughter,&#x201d; said George, standing up to give her a hug.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sadie felt a brief moment of birthday excitement, and then the house seemed to shake with a pounding on the front door, followed by an insistent baritone call: &#x201c;We&#x2019;re looking for George Alistair Woodbury!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; Sadie said, peering through the kitchen entrance and down the hall to the foyer. Red and blue flashed through the open windows, a light show for the symphony of cicadas. She approached the door tentatively. George sat back down at the table, staring into his glass of wine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Sadie, don&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;ll get it,&#x201d; Joan said as she approached the door, peering through the peephole cautiously. She opened it slowly to find two plainclothes detectives and several uniformed officers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, ma&#x2019;am, is your husband home?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They made it only a few feet down the front hall before spotting him through the living room, still at the kitchen table. He stood, knocking over his glass. It pooled, then slowly dripped onto the kitchen floor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For months Joan would replay this moment, trying to decipher the look on her husband&#x2019;s face. Was it guilt? Confusion? Indignation? Stoicism? Acting? But nothing, not even a revolving camera of omniscience, a floating momentary opportunity to narrate, would allow anyone to truly understand the truth about George. He became a hard statue, an obstacle, a symbol.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The father and the husband, from that moment, had been transformed.</p></p><h2>The Kefir Cookbook: An Ancient Healing Superfood for Modern Life, Recipes from My Family Table and Around the World</h2><p><p><strong>Over 100 globally-inspired sweet and savory recipes made with one of the most probiotic-rich and nutrient-dense superfoods on the planet</strong></p><p>Derived from the Turkish word &#x201c;keif&#x201d; meaning &#x201c;feeling good,&#x201d; kefir is a tart, tangy cultured milk, low in sugar and lactose free, and an excellent source of protein, calcium, and B vitamins.

As warm and intelligent as it is ribald and cunning, this collection of Thom Gunn's is his richest yet.</p></p><p><p><b>Thom Gunn</b>, born in 1929, has received many awards, most recently a Lila Acheson Wallace/Reader's Digest Fellowship and a MacArthur Fellowship. His works include <i>The Man with Night Sweats</i> and <i>Collected Poems</i>.</p>Duncan I When in his twenties a poetry's full strength Burst into voice as an unstopping flood, He let the divine prompting (come at length) Rushingly bear him any way it would And went on writing while the Ferry turned From San Francisco, back from Berkeley too, And back again, and back again. He learned You add to, you don't cancel what you do. Between the notebook-margins his pen travelled, His own lines carrying him in a new mode To ports in which past purposes unravelled. So that, as on the Ferry Line he rode, Whatever his first plans that night had been, The energy that rose from their confusion Became the changing passage lived within While the pen wrote, and looked beyond conclusion. 2 Forty years later, and both kidneys gone; Every eight hours, home dialysis; The habit of his restlessness stayed on Exhausting him with his responsiveness. After the circulations of one day In which he taught a three-hour seminar Then gave a reading clear across the Bay, And while returning from it to the car With plunging hovering tread tired and unsteady Down Wheeler steps, he faltered and he fell -Fell he said later, as if I stood ready, "Into the strong arms of Thom Gunn." <p>Well well, The image comic, as I might have known, And generous, but it turned things round to myth: He fell across the white steps there alone, Though it was me indeed that he was with. I hadn't caught him, hadn't seen in time, And picked him up where he had softly dropped, A pillow full of feathers. Was it a rime He later sought, in which he might adopt The role of H.D., broken-hipped and old, Who, as she moved off from the reading-stand, Had stumbled on the platform but was held And steadied by another poet's hand? He was now a posthumous poet, I have said (For since his illness he had not composed), In sight of a conclusion, whose great dread Was closure, </p><p>his life soon to be enclosed Like the sparrow's flight above the feasting friends, Briefly revealed where its breast caught their light, Beneath the long roof, between open ends, Themselves the margins of unchanging night. The Antagonism to Helena Shire The Makers did not make The muddy winter hardening to privation, Or cholera in the keep, or frost's long ache Afflicting every mortal nation From lord to villagers in their fading dyes -Those who like oxen strained On stony clearings of the ground From church to sties. They sought an utterance, Or sunshine soluble in institution, An orthodoxy justified, at once The dream and dreamer warmed in fusion, As in the great Rose Window, pieced from duty, Where through Christ's crimson, sun Shines on your clothes till they take on Value and beauty. But carved on a high beam Far in the vault from the official version Gape gnarled unChristian heads out of whom stream Long stems of contrary assertion, Shaped leaf ridging their scalps in place of hair. Their origins lost to sight, As they are too, cast out from light. They should despair. What stays for its own sake, Occulted in the dark, may slip an ending, Recalcitrant, and strengthened by the ache Of winter not for the transcending. Ice and snow pile the gables of the roof Within whose shade they hold, Intimate with its slaty cold, To Christ aloof.

In the three volumes of The Music Road, a comfortable sequence of steps is presented. Each unit is divided into three parts: &#34;Stop! Look! Learn!,&#34; in which new material for learning is presented with follow-up written assignments, &#34;Stop! Look! Play!,&#34; in which new material is used in simple playing experiences, short mini-melodies, and one measure musical examples, and &#34;Destination,&#34; which uses folk songs and original music to offer many, many opportunities to &#34;see and play&#34; what has been presented in the learning part of the unit. Each unit has a corresponding &#34;Stop! Listen!&#34; appendix in which the ear is trained to &#34;hear&#34; what has been &#34;seen&#34; on the printed page. Listening to &#34;high - low,&#34; keyboard location, quarter, half, whole notes, 3/4 - 4/4 time, and intervals are a few of the beginning focuses in Book 1. Relating the eye and ear in this way is excellent sensory reinforcement and makes sense, too, of music theory for the young student. An additional appendix contains a teacher&#39;s guide, and general and specific practice points to help the teacher and parent use The Music Road successfully. The slow progression throughout the books ensures the mastery of concepts, and the extensive use of those concepts at the keyboard gives the student a wonderful sense of accomplishment. The philosophical and psychological basis for the Music Road books is a natural extension of the Suzuki approach, yet teachers with traditional approaches find the books equally successful with their students.</p><p></p><h2>Much Ado in the Moonlight (Macleod Family)</h2><p>Award-winning and <b>USA Today</b> bestselling author Lynn Kurland &#x201c;consistently delivers the kind of stories readers dream about.&#x201d;* Now, she pens a wonderfully romantic tale about an eight-hundred-year-old ghost and the modern woman who turns his plans for a peaceful afterlife upside down...<p>When Victoria McKinnon&#x2019;s brother offers to finance her production of Hamlet, she leaps at the chance.

This controversy about the nature of mind which persists to the present day raises many questions.This book first presents the final exposition of special insight by Tsong-kha-pa, the founder of the Ge-luk-pa order of Tibetan Buddhism in his medium-length <i>Exposition of the Stages of the Path</i> as well as the sections on the object of negation and on the two truths in his <i>Illumination of the Thought: Extensive Explanation of Chandrakirti's Supplement to Nagarjuna's "Treatise on the Middle</i>." It then details the views of his predecessor Dol-po-pa Shay-rap Gyel-tsen, the seminal author of philosophical treatises of the Jo-nang-pa order as found in his <i>Mountain Doctrine</i> followed by an analysis of Tsong-kha-pa's reactions. By contrasting the two systems&#x2014;Dol-po-pa's doctrine of other-emptiness and Tsong-kha-pa's doctrine of self-emptiness&#x2014;both views emerge more clearly,contributing to a fuller picture of reality as viewed in Tibetan Buddhism. Tsong-kha-pa's <i>Final Exposition of Wisdom</i> brilliantly explicates ignorance and wisdom, explains the relationship between dependent-arising and emptiness, shows how to meditate on emptiness, and explains what it means to view phenomena as like illusions.</p><p>This is the final and clearest summary explanation of Buddhism's most perplexing issue by one of the luminaries of the tradition, presented and translated by America's leading Tibetan Buddhist scholar and interpreter for the Dalai Lama. <p>Tsong-kha-pa (1357-1419), the great Tibetan Buddhist master, directly and systematically addresses a host of essential questions in order to get at the nature of liberation. This volume presents the explanations found in Tsong-kha-pa's Medium-Length Exposition of the Stages of the Path and in a commentary Tsong-kha-pa supplied for Chandrakirti's supplement to Nagarjuna's Treatise on the Middle, contrasting them with views of his predecessor Dol-bo-ba Shay-rab Gyel-tsen (1292-1391), as found in Dol-bo-ba's Mountain Doctrine. By analyzing Tsong-kha-pa's reactions to Dol-ba-ba's views--Tsong-kha-pa's doctrine of self-emptiness and Dol-bo-ba's doctrine of other-emptiness--and contrasting the two systems, both sides emerge more clearly, contributing to fuller picture of reality as viewed in Tibetan Buddhism. </p><p>Jeffrey Hopkins is Professor Emeritus of Tibetan Buddhist Studies at the University of Virginia.

She can even cope (sort of) with her rocker ex-boyfriend's upcoming nuptials, which the press has dubbed <i>The</i> Celebrity Wedding of the Decade. But she's definitely having a hard time dealing with the situation in the dormitory kitchen&#x2014;where a cheerleader has lost her head on the first day of the semester. (Actually, her head is accounted for&#x2014;it's her torso that's AWOL.) </p> <p> Surrounded by hysterical students&#x2014;with her ex-con father on her doorstep and her ex-love bombarding her with unwanted phone calls&#x2014;Heather welcomes the opportunity to play detective . . . again. If it gets her mind off her personal problems&#x2014;and teams her up again with the gorgeous P.I. who owns the brownstone where she lives&#x2014;it's all good. But the murder trail is leading the average-sized amateur investigator into a shadowy world.

Meg lives in Key West, FL, with her husband.</p>In Cabot's entertaining, if flawed, second cozy (after 2006's <i>Size 12 Is Not Fat</i>) to feature Heather Wells, a teen music idol turned student-life employee at NYU-like New York College, a cheerleader in Heather's dorm turns up dead&#x2014;or, at least her head turns up, stewed almost beyond recognition in a cafeteria pot. Lindsay Combs was bubbly and popular, but as Heather digs deeper, she learns that Lindsay wasn't all sweetness and light. She slept around and was involved with obnoxious fraternity boys who made pin money dealing drugs. If solving Lindsay's murder isn't enough to keep Heather busy, her father, recently released after a 20-year prison sentence, shows up on her doorstep, looking for a renewed relationship and a place to stay. The roster of suspects is underdeveloped, and the denouement is both predictable and implausible, but Heather's charm and wit amply compensate. <i>(Nov. 28)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The takeaway from their volume is that too often we are held hostage by our personal &#x2018;scripts.&#x2019; Ones which fail to provide the comfort, safety, control, and predictability we expect from them. Instead, they frequently rob us of our nascent humor, spontaneity, playfulness, and joy. The authors&#x2019; mission is to teach us how to &#x2018;unscript&#x2019; ourselves. Chock-full of psychological insight, this book provides artful anecdotes from both psychotherapy and improvisation along with useful takeaway tips and exercises. Together they teach us to revel in, rather than recoil from, our everyday mistakes.

Let&#x2019;s march out into that sunlight, you Johnnies!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The bellowing voice erupted volcanically from somewhere behind him, echoing off the rafters of the dirty prison building, built on the order of a warehouse, now smelling of piss and decay and souls rotting away month after month until the time spilled together into years of captivity.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jonah Hook had vowed allegiance to the Union. He would put on a Yankee&#x2019;s blue uniform as long as he did not have to fight his former brethren dressed in butternut gray. He would go west with the others to hold back the Indians. He would keep the freight roads open and the telegraph wires strung across that expanse of open wilderness yawning out there in his imagination.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hell, Jonah would do anything just about to get out of that stinking cell where one more man had died before the winter sun came up to make the whole damned building steamy again.<br> &nbsp;<br> He wasn&#x2019;t going to wait until it was him they dragged out by the ankles while everybody turned away. Jonah Hook was going west dressed in Yankee blue.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the North for the past few months, President Lincoln had been engaged in a fierce campaign against his former chief of the army, George B. McClellan. Lincoln won a second term. But as the terrible human cost of the war mounted, the President&#x2019;s Union found it harder to recruit soldiers for the effort. Draft laws and conscription edicts did nothing but incite the Northerners into riots.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then there was Gettysburg, and the thousands of bodies piled up all in those three long days. Along with so many other less glorious battles with little-known and easily forgotten names, where thousands more lay waiting for a shallow grave, perhaps no grave at all, lying there for the animals and the seasons to reclaim their nameless mortal remains.<br> &nbsp;<br> There were damned few substitutes left among those Yankee states by 1864&#x2014;substitutes who would be paid a handsome bounty to serve in the stead of a man drafted to go fight the rebellious Confederates. So the Union continually drew manpower from its frontier army until it hurt, like an old-fashioned leech bleeding to cure a hopeless patient.<br> &nbsp;<br> With little else to do, the army figured these Confederates they would galvanize into Yankee soldiers could hold back the red tide on the frontier until Grant and Sherman and Sheridan finished their nasty little business in crushing what was left of resistance in the South.<br> &nbsp;<br> Make &#x2019;em all good Yankees by opening the doors for those who would go west&#x2014;what with the promise of more and better food, dry clothes and some fresh, clean air.<br> &nbsp;<br> So the eighteen hundred marched into the sunshine of this winter day. Still this place stunk of death, no matter the cold. If not of rotting flesh, then heavy with the stench of decaying souls.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Gimme a double column, Johnnies!&#x201d; hollered the throaty voice. &#x201c;Double column ... and march!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The blue-bellies marched them between the low warehouses, past one row of high fence, then a second, and at last beyond a line of trees Jonah could make out the huffing of smoke and the familiar cry of iron on iron as the huge engines scraped to a stop near a much-battered rail-station platform. He had not seen this place in years. Since a train much like this one had brought him here.<br> &nbsp;<br> But now this homely rail of a man all strap and sinew was headed west. Starved down to hide and bones by the years of hanging on, he was ready to be going anywhere. Jonah was scared nonetheless.<br> &nbsp;<br> The promise of rations enough to fill his belly sounded the best. No matter that he had to fight Injuns out there. He had volunteered last September, then waited all these months into the maw of winter until the Yankee officers got their galvanized conscripts organized into two new regiments of Injun fighters to help General Pope out on the frontier.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jonah damned well had lived on the frontier, leaving his birthplace of Virginia for the promise of rich land in southern Missouri, homesteading beside his uncle&#x2019;s place. He arrived to find it a land embroiled in fiery turmoil between free-staters and slavers. The Hooks had never owned a slave, but&#x2014;by God&#x2014;a white man had a right to his property, and no so-called government was going to take it away except at the point of a gun.<br> &nbsp;<br> As soon as Fort Sumter fell, the Union rushed their forces into Missouri to hold the line against the slavers. The state had a bad reputation for being a lawless land of bloody insurrection. A few zealots had been tramping back and forth across the southern forests and fields of Missouri, gaining converts and what money they could when they passed the hat. And when Sterling Price showed up down in Cassville, Jonah Hook told Gritta he had to go.<br> &nbsp;<br> At first they were nothing more than freebooters themselves, living off the land and the gracious help of other free-state sympathizers. Price kept his growing legions moving: destroying bridges, removing rail ties, setting fires beneath the iron rails until they could be bent shapeless, firing into passing trains until most rail traffic slowed and eventually halted.<br> &nbsp;<br> But then Brigadier General Samuel R. Curtis, a West Point man from Iowa, marched with his army into Missouri to destroy the State Guard. The Union soldiers met Price&#x2019;s ragtag volunteers near Springfield, down near Jonah&#x2019;s new home where Gritta and the children stayed on to work the fields. And Curtis drove Price farther south, beating his rear flank like a man would flog a tired, bony mule.<br> &nbsp;<br> A beating so bad that there were only twelve thousand of them left who stayed on with Price by the time they got to Pea Ridge in northern Arkansas in March of 1862.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was there that Price rejoined McCulloch and turned to fight. But General Earl Van Dorn and Curtis made quick work of the Southern farm boys on that bloody ridge strewn with bodies and torn by grapeshot and canister.<br> &nbsp;<br> Price escaped with a portion of his command: those who would still fight, those who had not headed home shoeless and demoralized.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jonah followed Price east into Mississippi for the great Corinth campaign. Saddened already: the best the Confederates could muster had not been good enough to push back the Yankees from the western borders.<br> &nbsp;<br> After his capture in Mississippi, Jonah had been marched and wagoned and railed mile after mile northward to a squalid prison that was swelled with new prisoners every week. Rock Island.<br> &nbsp;<br> For the longest time, Jonah had feared it would be the last place he would sleep in his life. Come one morning and never waking up again.<br> &nbsp;<br> Word was from one of the officers on the platform as the eighteen hundred were herded onto railcars that they were heading south and west.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know that place,&#x201d; Hook had whispered when someone mentioned their destination.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You been to Fort Leavenworth, friend?&#x201d; asked the fellow behind him on the platform.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, but, it&#x2019;s close to home ... closer to home than I been in years now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go fooling yourself, friend,&#x201d; whispered the disembodied voice behind him. &#x201c;You ain&#x2019;t gonna be nowhere near home&#x2014;what they got planned for us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; asked someone farther back.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t you heard?&#x201d; responded still another voice off in another column. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re being sent out yonder to fight all them Injuns the Yankees cain&#x2019;t whip.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Never before could he remember such a glorious chance to clear the white man&#x2019;s Holy Road of emigrants in their wagons. So few soldiers left out here now that the white man was making war on himself back east.<br> &nbsp;<br> Crazy Horse pulled the buffalo robe tighter beneath his chin. The sun shone brightly on the patches of old snow, it and the breeze cold enough to make his eyes smart.<br> &nbsp;<br> For the past three winters while the warrior bands roaming to the south had hacked at the Holy Road, and the Santee Sioux to the east had waged war against the whites in Minnesota, this young Oglalla warrior had stayed north among the villages of his people, living off the buffalo grown fat on the tall grass. He had discovered that the solution to the white man moving onto the plains was to stay away from the white man altogether. Everything north of Fort Laramie was tranquil. The white man did not venture north into the land of the Lakota.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet in the time of drying grass last summer, even Crazy Horse had grown restive and yearned for the excitement talked about on everyone&#x2019;s lips&#x2014;ponies and plunder and coup to be found far to the south in the white man&#x2019;s settlements just south of Fort Laramie.</p><h2>Memphis.

Memphis was preceded in 1976 by the Milan-based avant-garde collective, Studio Alchimia. Sottsass, who designed for Studio Alchimia, left to form Memphis in 1981 and would ultimately attract leading designers such as Andrea Branzi, Michael Graves, Shiro Kuramata, Alessandro Mendini, Marco Zanuso and Nathalie Du Pasquier to the movement. They rejected the austerity of mid-century modernists like Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier and approached the object with an unfettered, often irreverent, visual vocabulary and an exuberant sense of play applied to shape, material, and pattern.<br><br>This book, the catalogue for a show at MADD-Bordeaux, looks at the genesis of the Memphis collective and the furniture, household objects, glassware, lighting, ceramics, and textiles they designed.

He lives in Berkeley, California with his wife, the novelist Ayelet Waldman, and their children.With this varied collection of enchanting though not always astonishing tales, Chabon (who also edited <i>McSweeney's Mammoth Treasury of Thrilling Tales</i>) aims for an anthology full of "genre bending and stylistic play." There's quite a lineup of writers taking a stab at "genre" fiction here: many expected (Margaret Atwood, Stephen King), but a few surprises as well, and a newcomer or two. Atwood offers a fantastical tale of a human "lusus naturae" (freak of nature) who suffers from a nameless disease that results in yellow eyes, red fingernails and fangs&#x2014;how does such a creature fit into a family? Jonathan Lethem's charming "Vivian Relf," which concerns two strangers who seem familiar to each other and who continue to cross each others' paths, is a kind of love story, but there are also tales creepy (Jason Roberts's "7C") and strange (China Mi�ville's "Reports of Certain Events in London"). Stephen King's "Lisey and the Madman" is full of engaging detail and feeling. While a couple of stories fail to reach the high-water mark, this collection will offer readers plenty of pleasure and perhaps even a sense of doing good (an endnote says that "this book benefits 826 Valencia," the San Francisco writing lab founded by Dave Eggers and Co.). <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Finally, she proposes a range of choices by which people can identify themselves, secure that the masculine/feminine interaction within each individual is not only normal, but the dynamic factor in their wholeness.</p></p><p>Scientists and mystics throughout history have realized that every human being is a carrier of opposite and complementary life energies. Given a variety of names -- yin and yang, poetic and rational, emotional and intellectual, feminine and masculine -- these energies exist in everyone, regardless of sex. Androgyny involves recognizing the eternal flux of these opposing energies within us.<p>On a journey that takes us through Taoism, Gnosticism, Kabbalah, Alchemy, Astrology, Tibetan Tantra, Kundalini Yoga, and the works of Plato, Freud, and Jung, June Singer shows how crucial awareness of the androgynous soul has been to those inquiring into the mysteries of human nature. Consciousness of our own androgyny can lead to a new sense of personal unity within the larger universe. It is no accident that men and women today are expressing previously undeveloped sides of their natures.</p><p>One of the most thorough investigations of the subject in the current literature, Androgyny is full of psychological and spiritual insights that speak to today's sexual confusion.

Introduced only 12 years after the sound barrier was first broken, this iconic plane became the first large long-range supersonic bomber to take to the skies, a feat which had seemed far-fetched only a few years previously. Outstripping its contemporaries in terms of speed, and agile enough to escape most interceptors, the B-58 was a remarkable feat of engineering, setting 19 world speed records and collecting a host of trophies. The first operational bomber capable of Mach 2 at 63,000 feet, it was able to evade hostile fighters and represented a serious threat to targets across the Soviet Bloc.<br>Supported by contemporary first-hand accounts, photography, and full-color illustrations, this study explores the history of this groundbreaking aircraft from its conception to its little-known testing for use in the Vietnam War.</p></p><p><p><b>Peter E Davies</b> has published over 30 aviation books, most of them for Osprey.

Conflict raged along the Canadian border, as international tensions prompted Thomas Jefferson to ban American exports to France and Great Britain. Some Vermonters turned to smuggling. Federal seizure of a boat called the Black Snake&#34; went deadly wrong--three men were killed that day, and another died later in the state&#39;s first hanging execution. The outbreak of the War of 1812 brought thousands of troops, along with drunkenness, disease and a general disregard of civil rights, including the imposition of extra-legal military trials. Using his extensive knowledge of the law, author Gary Shattuck sheds new light on this riotous era.&#34;</p><p>1</p><h2>Natural Causes (Detective Inspector MacLean) (Detective Inspector MacLean, 1)</h2><p>A young girl's mutilated body is discovered in a room that has lain sealed for the last sixty years.

After weeks of heavy fighting, the Germans breached the Soviet defenses and overran most of the Crimea. By November 1941 the only remaining Soviet foothold in the area was the heavily fortified naval base at Sevastopol. </p><p>Operation Sturgeon Haul, the final assault on Sevastopol, was one of the very few joint service German operations of World War II, with two German corps and a Romanian corps supported by a huge artillery siege train, the Luftwaffe's crack VIII Flieger Korps and a flotilla of S-Boats provided by the Kriegsmarine. This volume closely examines the impact of logistics, weather and joint operational planning upon the last major German victory in World War II (1939-1945).</p></p><p>Dr Robert A. Forczyk has a PhD in International Relations and National Security from the University of Maryland and a strong background in European and Asian military history.

In Touches of Sweet Harmony, S. K. Heninger first recounts the legendary life of Pythagoras, describes his school at Croton, and discusses the materials from which the Renaissance drew its information about Pythagorean doctrine. The second section of the book reconstructs the many facets of this doctrine, and the final section shows its influence on Renaissance poetics. Professor Heninger&#39;s magisterial work introduces the reader not only to Pythagoras but to a host of other classical, medieval, and Renaissance figures as well--from Plato and Aristotle through St. Augustine and Macrobius down to Sidney and Spenser.</p><p></p><h2>Ecumenism and Interreligious Dialogue: Unitatis Redintegratio, Nostra Aetate (Rediscovering Vatican II)</h2><p>In commemoration of the 40th anniversary of Vatican II, Paulist Press has created a groundbreaking 8-book series, Rediscovering Vatican II, that places the Council in dialogue with today's church and her people and focuses on what today's Catholics need to know, not just historically. The first volume, Ecumenism and Interreligious Dialogue: Unitatis redintegratio, Nostra aetate, looks at the relationship of the Catholic Church with other Christian churches and other great religions. <p>Cardinal Cassidy devotes part one of his book to Unitatis redintegratio, the decree on Restoring Christian Unity, which brought the Catholic Church into the modern ecumenical movement. And in part two, Nostra aetate (the Declaration on Interreligious Dialogue), he looks at the relationship of the Catholic Church with other world religions. </p><p>This work, and indeed the entire series, which is the only one of its kind at this level and organization, will prove valuable for religious educators, theologians, church historians (of all faiths, especially Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), undergrad and grad students, as well as readers who have heard much about Vatican II, but who have never sat down to understand certain aspects of it.</p></p><p>Edward Idris Cardinal Cassidy holds a doctorate in Canon Law from Lateran University.

George is enthralled by Cecil, and soon his sister, Daphne, is equally besotted by him. That weekend, Cecil writes a poem that, after he is killed in the Great War and his reputation burnished, will become a touchstone for a generation, a work recited by every schoolchild in England. Over time, a tragic love story is spun, even as other secrets lie buried&#x2014;until, decades later, an ambitious biographer threatens to unearth them.</p></p><p><p>ALAN HOLLINGHURST is the author of the novels&nbsp;<i>The Stranger's Child, The Swimming-Pool Library, The Folding Star, The Spell</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Line of Beauty,</i>&nbsp;which won the Man Booker Prize and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award.

Forster Award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction.</p>I<br><br>She&#x2019;d been lying in the hammock reading poetry for over an hour. It wasn&#x2019;t easy: she was thinking all the while about George coming back with Cecil, and she kept sliding down, in small half-willing surrenders, till she was in a heap, with the book held tiringly above her face. Now the light was going, and the words began to hide among themselves on the page. She wanted to get a look at Cecil, to drink him in for a minute before he saw her, and was introduced, and asked her what she was reading. But he must have missed his train, or at least his connection: she saw him pacing the long platform at Harrow and Wealdstone, and rather regretting he&#x2019;d come. Five minutes later, as the sunset sky turned pink above the rockery, it began to seem possible that something worse had happened. With sudden grave excitement she pictured the arrival of a telegram, and the news being passed round; imagined weeping pretty wildly; then saw herself describing the occasion to someone, many years later, though still without quite deciding what the news had been.<br><br>In the sitting-room the lamps were being lit, and through the open window she could hear her mother talking to Mrs. Kalbeck, who had come to tea, and who tended to stay, having no one to get back for. The glow across the path made the garden suddenly lonelier. Daphne slipped out of the hammock, put on her shoes, and forgot about her books. She started towards the house, but something in the time of day held her, with its hint of a mystery she had so far overlooked: it drew her down the lawn, past the rockery, where the pond that reflected the trees in silhouette had grown as deep as the white sky. It was the long still moment when the hedges and borders turned dusky and vague, but anything she looked at closely, a rose, a begonia, a glossy laurel leaf, seemed to give itself back to the day with a secret throb of colour.<br><br>She heard a faint familiar sound, the knock of the broken gate against the post at the bottom of the garden; and then an unfamiliar voice, with an edge to it, and then George&#x2019;s laugh. He must have brought Cecil the other way, through the Priory and the woods. Daphne ran up the narrow half-hidden steps in the rockery and from the top she could just make them out in the spinney below. She couldn&#x2019;t really hear what they were saying, but she was disconcerted by Cecil&#x2019;s voice; it seemed so quickly and decisively to take control of their garden and their house and the whole of the coming weekend. It was an excitable voice that seemed to say it didn&#x2019;t care who heard it, but in its tone there was also something mocking and superior. She looked back at the house, the dark mass of the roof and the chimney-stacks against the sky, the lamp-lit windows under low eaves, and thought about Monday, and the life they would pick up again very readily after Cecil had gone.<br><br>Under the trees the dusk was deeper, and their little wood seemed interestingly larger. The boys were dawdling, for all Cecil&#x2019;s note of impatience. Their pale clothes, the rim of George&#x2019;s boater, caught the failing light as they moved slowly between the birch-trunks, but their faces were hard to make out. George had stopped and was poking at something with his foot, Cecil, taller, standing close beside him, as if to share his view of it. She went cautiously towards them, and it took her a moment to realize that they were quite unaware of her; she stood still, smiling awkwardly, let out an anxious gasp, and then, mystified and excited, began to explore her position. She knew that Cecil was a guest and too grown-up to play a trick on, though George was surely in her power. But having the power, she couldn&#x2019;t think what to do with it. Now Cecil had his hand on George&#x2019;s shoulder, as if consoling him, though he was laughing too, more quietly than before; the curves of their two hats nudged and overlapped. She thought there was something nice in Cecil&#x2019;s laugh, after all, a little whinny of good fun, even if, as so often, she was not included in the joke. Then Cecil raised his head and saw her and said, &#x201c;Oh, hello!&#x201d; as if they&#x2019;d already met several times and enjoyed it.<br><br>George was confused for a second, peered at her as he quickly buttoned his jacket, and said, &#x201c;Cecil missed his train,&#x201d; rather sharply. &#x201c;Well, clearly,&#x201d; said Daphne, who chose a certain dryness of tone against the constant queasy likelihood of being teased.<br><br>&#x201c;And then of course I had to see Middlesex,&#x201d; said Cecil, coming forward and shaking her hand. &#x201c;We seem to have tramped over much of the county.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He brought you the country way,&#x201d; said Daphne. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s the country way, and the suburban way, which doesn&#x2019;t create such a fine impression. You just go straight up Stanmore Hill.&#x201d;<br><br>George wheezed with embarrassment, and also a kind of relief. &#x201c;There, Cess, you&#x2019;ve met my sister.&#x201d;<br><br>Cecil&#x2019;s hand, hot and hard, was still gripping hers, in a frank, convivial way. It was a large hand, and somehow unfeeling; a hand more used to gripping oars and ropes than the slender fingers of sixteen-yearold girls. She took in his smell, of sweat and grass, the sourness of his breath. When she started to pull her fingers out, he squeezed again, for a second or two, before releasing her. She didn&#x2019;t like the sensation, but in the minute that followed she found that her hand held the memory of his hand, and half-wanted to reach out through the shadows and touch it again.<br><br>&#x201c;I was reading poetry,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m afraid it grew too dark to see.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; said Cecil, with his quick high laugh, that was almost a snigger; but she sensed he was looking at her kindly. In the late dusk they had to peer closely to be sure of each other&#x2019;s expressions; it made them seem particularly interested in each other. &#x201c;Which poet?&#x201d;<br><br>She had Tennyson&#x2019;s poems, and also the Granta, with three of Cecil&#x2019;s own poems in it, &#x201c;Corley,&#x201d; &#x201c;Dawn at Corley&#x201d; and &#x201c;Corley: Dusk.&#x201d; She said, &#x201c;Oh, Alfred, Lord Tennyson.&#x201d;<br><br>Cecil nodded slowly and seemed amused by searching for the kind and lively thing to say. &#x201c;Do you find he still holds up?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh yes,&#x201d; said Daphne firmly, and then wondered if she&#x2019;d understood the question. She glanced between the lines of trees, but with a sense of other shadowy perspectives, the kind of Cambridge talk that George often treated them to, where things were insisted on that couldn&#x2019;t possibly be meant. It was a refinement of teasing, where you were never told why your answer was wrong. &#x201c;We all love Tennyson here,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;at &#x2018;Two Acres.&#x2019; &#x201d; <br><br>Now Cecil&#x2019;s eyes seemed very playful, under the broad peak of his cap. &#x201c;Then I can see we shall get on,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s all read out our favourite poems&#x2014;if you like to read aloud.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh yes!&#x201d; said Daphne, excited already, though she&#x2019;d never heard Hubert read out anything except a letter in <i>The Times</i> that he agreed with. &#x201c;Which is your favourite?&#x201d; she said, with a moment&#x2019;s worry that she wouldn&#x2019;t have heard of it. <br><br>Cecil smiled at them both, savouring his power of choice, and said, &#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;ll find out when I read it to you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hope it&#x2019;s not &#x2018;The Lady of Shalott,&#x2019; &#x201d; said Daphne.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I like &#x2018;The Lady of Shalott.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I mean, that&#x2019;s my favourite,&#x201d; said Daphne.<br><br>George said, &#x201c;Well, come up and meet Mother,&#x201d; spreading his arms to shepherd them.<br><br>&#x201c;And Mrs. Kalbeck&#x2019;s here too,&#x201d; said Daphne, &#x201c;by the way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then we&#x2019;ll try and get rid of her,&#x201d; said George.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you can try . . . ,&#x201d; said Daphne.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m already feeling sorry for Mrs. Kalbeck,&#x201d; said Cecil, &#x201c;whoever she may be.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a big black beetle,&#x201d; said George, &#x201c;who took Mother to Germany last year, and hasn&#x2019;t let go of her since.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a German widow,&#x201d; said Daphne, with a note of sad realism and a pitying shake of the head. She found Cecil had spread his arms too and, hardly thinking, she did the same; for a moment they seemed united in a lightly rebellious pact.<br>2<br>While the maid was removing the tea-things, Freda Sawle stood up and wandered between the small tables and numerous little armchairs to the open window. A few high streaks of cloud glowed pink above the rockery, and the garden itself was stilled in the first grey of the twilight. It was a time of day that played uncomfortably on her feelings. &#x201c;I suppose my child is straining her eyes out there somewhere,&#x201d; she said, turning back to the warmer light of the room.<br><br>&#x201c;If she has her poetry books,&#x201d; said Clara Kalbeck.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s been studying some of Cecil Valance&#x2019;s poems. She says they are very fine, but not so good as Swinburne or Lord Tennyson.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Swinburne . . . ,&#x201d; said Mrs. Kalbeck, with a wary chuckle.<br><br>&#x201c;All the poems of Cecil&#x2019;s that I&#x2019;ve seen have been about his own house. Though George says he has others, of more general interest.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I feel I know a good deal about Cecil Valance&#x2019;s house,&#x201d; said Clara, with the slight asperity that gave even her nicest remarks an air of sarcasm.<br><br>Freda paced the short distance to the musical end of the room, the embrasure with the piano and the dark cabinet of the gramophone. George himself had turned rather critical of &#x201c;Two Acres&#x201d; since his visit to Corley Court. He said it had a way of &#x201c;resolving itself into nooks.&#x201d; This nook had its own little window, and was spanned by a broad oak beam.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re very late,&#x201d; said Freda, &#x201c;though George says Cecil is hopeless about time.&#x201d;<br><br>Clara looked tolerantly at the clock on the mantelpiece. &#x201c;I think perhaps they are rambling around.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, who knows what George is doing with him!&#x201d; said Freda, and frowned at her own sharp tone.<br><br>&#x201c;He may have lost his connection at Harrow and Wealdstone,&#x201d; said Clara.<br><br>&#x201c;Quite so,&#x201d; said Freda; and for a moment the two names, with the pinched vowels, the throaty r, the blurred W that was almost an F, struck her as a tiny emblem of her friend&#x2019;s claim on England, and Stanmore, and her. She stopped to make adjustments to the framed photographs that stood in an expectant half-circle on a small round table. Dear Frank, in a studio setting, with his hand on another small round table. Hubert in a rowing-boat and George on a pony. She pushed the two of them apart, to give Daphne more prominence. Often she was glad of Clara&#x2019;s company, and her unselfconscious willingness to sit, for long hours at a time. She was no less good a friend for being a pitiful one. Freda had three children, the telephone, and an upstairs bathroom; Clara had none of these amenities, and it was hard to begrudge her when she laboured up the hill from damp little &#x201c;Lorelei&#x201d; in search of talk. Tonight, though, with dinner raising tensions in the kitchen, her staying-put showed a certain insensitivity.<br><br>&#x201c;One can see George is so happy to be having his friend,&#x201d; said Clara.<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; said Freda, sitting down again with a sudden return of patience. &#x201c;And of course I&#x2019;m happy too. Before, he never seemed to have anybody.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps losing a father made him shy,&#x201d; said Clara. &#x201c;He wanted only to be with you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mm, you may be right,&#x201d; said Freda, piqued by Clara&#x2019;s wisdom, and touched at the same time by the thought of George&#x2019;s devotion. &#x201c;But he&#x2019;s certainly changing now. I can see it in his walk. And he whistles a great deal, which usually shows that a man&#x2019;s looking forward to something . . .Of course he loves Cambridge. He loves the life of ideas.&#x201d; She saw the paths across and around the courts of the colleges as ideas, with the young men following them, through archways, and up staircases. Beyond were the gardens and river-banks, the hazy dazzle of social freedom, where George and his friends stretched out on the grass, or slipped by in punts. She said cautiously, &#x201c;You know he has been elected to the Conversazione Society.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed . . . ,&#x201d; said Clara, with a vague shake of the head.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not allowed to know about it. But it&#x2019;s philosophy, I think. Cecil Valance got him into it. They discuss ideas. I think George said they discuss &#x2018;Does this hearth-rug exist?&#x2019; That kind of thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The big questions,&#x201d; said Clara.<br><br>Freda laughed guiltily and said, &#x201c;I understand it&#x2019;s a great honour to be a member.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And Cecil is older than George,&#x201d; said Clara.<br><br>&#x201c;I believe two or three years older, and already quite an expert on some aspect of the Indian Mutiny. Apparently he hopes to be a Fellow of the college.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He is offering to help George.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I think they&#x2019;re great friends!&#x201d;<br><br>Clara let a moment pass. &#x201c;Whatever the reason,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;George is blooming.&#x201d;<br><br>Freda smiled firmly, as she took up her friend&#x2019;s idea. &#x201c;I know,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s coming into bloom, at last!&#x201d; The image was both beautiful and vaguely unsettling. Then Daphne was sticking her head through the window and shouting,<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re here!&#x201d;&#x2014;sounding furious with them for not knowing.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, good,&#x201d; said her mother, standing up again.<br><br>&#x201c;Not a moment too soon,&#x201d; said Clara Kalbeck, with a dry laugh, as if her own patience had been tried by the wait. <br><br>Daphne glanced quickly over her shoulder, before saying, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s extremely charming, you know, but he has a rather carrying voice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And so have you, my dear,&#x201d; said Freda. &#x201c;Now do go and bring him in.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I shall depart,&#x201d; said Clara, quietly and gravely.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, nonsense,&#x201d; said Freda, surrendering as she had suspected she would, and getting up and going into the hall. As it happened Hubert had just got home from work, and was standing at the front door in his bowler hat, almost throwing two brown suitcases into the house. He said,<br><br>&#x201c;I brought these up with me in the van.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, they must be Cecil&#x2019;s,&#x201d; said Freda. &#x201c;Yes, &#x2018;C. T. V.,&#x2019; look. Do be careful . . .&#x201d; Her elder son was a well-built boy, with a surprisingly ruddy moustache, but she saw in a moment, in the light of her latest conversation, that he hadn&#x2019;t yet bloomed, and would surely be completely bald before he had had the chance. She said, &#x201c;And a most intriguing packet has come for you. Good evening, Hubert.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good evening, Mother,&#x201d; said Hubert, leaning over the cases to kiss her on the cheek. It was the little dry comedy of their relations, which somehow turned on the fact that Hubert wasn&#x2019;t lightly amused, perhaps didn&#x2019;t even know there was anything comic about them. &#x201c;Is this it?&#x201d; he said, picking up a small parcel wrapped in shiny red paper. &#x201c;It looks more like a lady&#x2019;s thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, so I had hoped,&#x201d; said his mother, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s from Mappin&#x2019;s&#x2014;,&#x201d; as behind her, where the garden door had stood open all day, the others were arriving: waiting a minute outside, in the soft light that spread across the path, George and Cecil arm in arm, gleaming against the dusk, and Daphne just behind, wide-eyed, with a part in the drama, the person who had found them. Freda had a momentary sense of Cecil leading George, rather than George presenting his friend; and Cecil himself, crossing the threshold in his pale linen clothes, with only his hat in his hand, seemed strangely unencumbered. He might have been coming in from his own garden.</p><h2>The Land of Milk and Uncle Honey: Memories from the Farm of My Youth</h2><p>Bon Appetit Magazine's 20 Food Books to Read This Summer<br> Los Angeles Magazine's Top 10 Summer Books for Foodies<br> Food Tank's Summer Reading List<br><br>"The river was in God's hands, the cows in ours." So passed the days on Indian Farm, a dairy operation on 700 acres of rich Illinois bottomland. In this collection, Alan Guebert and his daughter-editor Mary Grace Foxwell recall Guebert's years on the land working as part of that all-consuming collaborative effort known as the family farm.<br><br>Here are Guebert's tireless parents, measuring the year not in months but in seasons for sewing, haying, and doing the books; Jackie the farmhand, needing ninety minutes to do sixty minutes' work and cussing the entire time; Hoard the dairyman, sore fingers wrapped in electrician's tape, sharing wine and the prettiest Christmas tree ever; and the unflappable Uncle Honey, spreading mayhem via mistreated machinery, flipped wagons, and the careless union of diesel fuel and fire.<br><br>Guebert's heartfelt and humorous reminiscences depict the hard labor and simple pleasures to be found in ennobling work, and show that in life, as in farming, Uncle Honey had it right with his succinct philosophy for overcoming adversity: "the secret's not to stop."<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DooGQqUlXI4&amp;;index=1&amp;list=FLPxtuez-lmHxi5zpooYEnBg</p><p>The good life at fifty cents an hour on a southern Illinois dairy farm<br>In <i>The Land of Milk and Uncle Honey</i>, we explain how farmers and families in the 1960s maintained the "culture" in "agriculture." That was a key, vital element in America back then, and our rural schools, churches, businesses, and communities reflected that value. We didn't do anything special or different than our neighbors; they had beef cows or chickens or hogs, and we had milk cows. The separate pieces of the neighborhood, however, made an integrated whole; we often worked together in annual jobs like hog butchering and silage making. Now it seems to be more about money, land, and power and that, too, is reflected in our dead or barely alive rural businesses, schools, churches, Main Streets, and communities. The stories in the book are mine; they are my memories and what I was taught to believe. The subsequent 50 years have afforded me plenty of time and experience to test those beliefs, and while some were shown wanting, most have held up pretty well. Those beliefs include: People are as important as the land; good food is timeless; real pleasure comes from truth; Mother Nature works 24/7 therefore she is always in charge; dust to dust isn't just a truism; and perhaps most importantly, nothing is "new" and truly everything returns on the circling winds. I'd like to see changes in U.S. food policy to make farming more people-directed. That means more focused on farmers and less on farm production, more attention to rural communities than agricultural economics, more on food than farm profits. There's another book in there, right? -<b>Alan Guebert</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Land of Milk and Uncle Honey </i>is a collection of heartwarming stories of a southern Illinois farm but it by no means romanticizes rural life or the very hard work required of farming. Furthermore, Indian Farm relied not only on adults but also on children, to milk the 100 dairy cows twice daily, to haul 90-pound sacks of soybean meal, and to can 100 quarts of peaches in one day. I note in the book's epilogue, "Dad reported the hard, indisputable facts while also recounting those truths the way he remembers them, and the way he would prefer them to be remembered." In this vein, I think our book touches both young and old, and urban and rural readers. We all have to eat, and more of us are caring where our food comes from, and who works tirelessly to put it on our table. This book reminds us of what is truly required of real, honest farming: humility, selflessness, community, and care for the environment, land, and animals. -<b>Mary Grace Foxwell&nbsp;</b></p><h2>The Rivals of Versailles: A Novel (The Mistresses of Versailles Trilogy)</h2><p><i>And you thought sisters were a thing to fear.</i> In this captivating follow-up to Sally Christie&#x2019;s clever and absorbing debut, we meet none other than the Marquise de Pompadour, one of the greatest beauties of her generation and the first bourgeois mistress ever to grace the hallowed halls of Versailles.<br><br>The year is 1745 and King Louis XV&#x2019;s bed is once again empty.

She catches me staring and starts, rabbitlike, as though she recognizes me. But she does not, and I certainly don&#x2019;t know anyone quite so dirty.<br> <br>&#x201c;I pray you not to touch me,&#x201d; I say as she comes toward me, but still there is something familiar about her. My mother bustles over, carrying a pastry in the shape of a pig, and pulls me back from the filthy woman.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just look at those perfect eyes,&#x201d; says the woman. She takes my hand, a coarse brown mitt over my own, and I smell a mix of smoke and sweat. &#x201c;And that heart-shaped face. She is as pretty as a miracle, though no wonder with such a handsome mother. I&#x2019;ll tell you her fortune.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We have no need of counsel from the likes of you,&#x201d; says my mother harshly and pulls me away into the crowd, almost colliding with a pair of shepherds reeling in a drunken dance. The fair is in full swing, a riot of festivity and noise billowing around us:<br> <br>&#x201c;Fresh lemons and fresh lemonade, sugared or not! Fresh lemons, straight from Provence.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A pair of dancing ducks! A pair of dancing ducks!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come see the white bear, only fifteen sous!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; wheedles the gypsy woman, appearing once again at our side. &#x201c;I will tell her future.

Jo&#x2014; Jeanne?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh! But Jeanne is my name!&#x201d; I exclaim. How did she know?<br> <br>My mother wavers. &#x201c;No more than fifty sous, mind you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Eighty is my price, but none has ever been dissatisfied.&#x201d;<br> <br>The two women stare at each other and I stomp my foot, impatient to be away and see the dancing ducks. I have no need for my future to be told, for what nine-year-old ever doubted their happiness? They reach an understanding and reluctantly I follow the red-haired woman into the gloaming of her tent. Something slithers in the dirty rushes at my feet and the foul odor of uncured leather swamps the air. Smoothly she pockets the coins my mother gives her and her hands, as coarse as bark, fold over mine again.<br> <br>&#x201c;No cards?&#x201d; asks my mother imperiously.<br> <br>&#x201c;No need,&#x201d; says the woman. The outside world fades and the gypsy seems to grow in stature and dignity. Brown fingers steal over my palms, and up and around my wrists.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your daughter is a pearl.&#x201d; She speaks as though in a trance. &#x201c;So rare&#x2014;open hundreds of oysters, but you&#x2019;ll find only one pearl.&#x201d; Soon we are lulled by the soft stream of her voice: &#x201c;Your future extends even beyond the ambitions of your mother. You will be loved by a king, and be the most powerful woman in the land. Your future glitters like the stars. A little queen: I see it as though it passes in front of me.&#x201d;<br> <br>She snaps out of her trance and smiles ingratiatingly at my mother. &#x201c;And there, madame, the fortune of your daughter.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How do I know it is true?&#x201d; asks my mother, and her voice comes from far away; she is as spellbound as I.<br> <br>The gypsy snorts and spits neatly into the rushes. &#x201c;Because I can see what is to come. This little girl is special. She will be the lover of a king.&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother flinches. I know vaguely what a lover is: a nice man who brings gifts and compliments, like my Uncle Norman.<br> <br>&#x201c;The way is not all clear,&#x201d; the gypsy continues, stroking my palm lightly. &#x201c;I see several great sorrows, three men on dark horses riding across the plain.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;None of that,&#x201d; says Mama sharply. &#x201c;She is much too young.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Three is a number far less than most will know,&#x201d; retorts the gypsy.<br> <br>We emerge back into the crisp sunshine of the October day, the world bright and noisy after the confines of the dirty tent.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mama,&#x201d; I ask timidly, uncertain of asking for a trifle after such momentous news, &#x201c;can we go and see the ducks now? The dancing ducks?&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother looks down at me and for a second it is as though she knows me not. Then she blinks and squeezes my hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course, darling. Of course. My Reinette,&#x201d; she adds. &#x201c;My little queen. What wonderful news! Come, let us go and see these ducks you have been pestering me about all morning. Anything for my little queen.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>That night Mama&#x2019;s lover Norman comes to visit. Papa is away in Germany, disgraced for some business no one will explain to me, and it is Norman who takes care of us. Uncle Norman, as I call him, often spends the night. I&#x2019;m not sure why, for his house is far grander than ours. We don&#x2019;t keep a single manservant, only Nurse, and Sylvie in the kitchens. Perhaps he is lonely&#x2014;he is not married&#x2014;or his sheets are being laundered. Mama is very beautiful and Sylvie once said that we only live comfortably because of Mama&#x2019;s friends. It is good she has so many.<br> <br>Mama and Uncle Norman closet themselves in the salon and I eat alone with Nurse and my little brother, Abel, who fusses and spits out his milk. I think of the fortune-teller and her hands, like dried old leather&#x2014;how did they get so rough?<br> <br>&#x201c;Marie, do you think our king is handsome?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course he is, duck. The most handsome man in France, as is fitting.&#x201d; We have a portrait of the king in the salon: a small boy, stiff in a magnificent red coat, with large eyes and thick brown hair. I think he looks sad, and quite lonely. He was only five when he became king. That must have been difficult, with still so much to learn, and who would play with a king?<br> <br>Of course, the king is older now&#x2014;he turned twenty this year, more than double my age&#x2014;and is married to a Polish princess. Sylvie says the queen looks like a cow and I imagine her to be very beautiful, with large, soft eyes and a peaceful expression. How lucky she is to be married to the king!<br> <br>Later that evening my mother comes to say good night. She pushes a strand of hair back into my nightcap and strokes my cheek. I love my mother with all my heart; the nuns at school say the heart in my chest is no bigger than a chestnut, but how can something so small hold so much love?<br> <br>&#x201c;Dearest, your Uncle Norman and I have come to a decision.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oui, Maman.&#x201d; I am fighting to keep my eyes open but what Mama says next opens them wide.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jeanne, darling, we have decided you will not return to the convent.&#x201d;<br> <br>Oh! &#x201c;But why, Mama?&#x201d; I sit up and duck her caressing hands. &#x201c;I love the convent! And the nuns! And my friend Claudine, and what about Chester?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who is Chester?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Our pet crow!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Darling, these things are for the best. You must trust Uncle Norman and me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But why?&#x201d; I ask, tears pricking my eyes. I love the convent and had secretly been counting the days until my return. Only twelve, but now that number has become forever.<br> <br>&#x201c;Darling, you heard the gypsy woman. You have a great future ahead. My little Reinette.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why do you care what that smelly old woman said? It&#x2019;s not fair!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Reinette! Never speak like that about other people. No matter how dirty they may be. Now, listen, dearest. Uncle Norman has agreed to take care of your education. This is a wonderful opportunity and you will learn far more than the nuns could teach you.&#x201d; My mother imparts her desires through her tightening grip on my hands. &#x201c;He promises you will learn with the finest musicians in the land. We&#x2019;ll buy a clavichord! And take lessons in painting, and drawing, and singing. Anything you desire.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Geography?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;Certainly, that too, darling. We shall order a globe from Germaine&#x2019;s. And elocution as well, I think. Though your voice is very pretty by nature.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mama leaves and I snuggle down to sleep, happy, dreaming of my very own clavichord. I will write to Claudine very often and we will always remain friends, and they will take care of Chester and all will be well. As I drift down to sleep, I realize I forgot to ask why Uncle Norman is suddenly taking such a strong and expensive interest in my education.</p><h2>Farming the Dust Bowl: A First-Hand Account from Kansas</h2><p>After northern Wisconsin was cleared by commercial loggers early in the twentieth century, enthusiastic promoters and optimistic settlers envisioned transforming this "cutover" into a land of yeoman farmers. Here thousands of families&#x2014;mostly immigrants or second-generation Americans&#x2014;sought to recreate old worlds and build new farms on land that would come to be considered agriculturally worthless. In the end, they succumbed not to drought or soil depletion but to social and political pressures from those who looked askance at their way of life.<br><br><i>Farming the Cutover</i> describes the visions and accomplishments of these settlers from their own perspective. People of the cutover managed to forge lives relatively independent of market pressures; and for this they were characterized as backward by outsiders and their part of the state was seen as a hideout for organized crime figures. State and federal planners, county agents, and agriculture professors eventually determined that the cutover could be engineered and the lives of its inhabitants improved. By 1940, they had begun to implement public policies that discouraged farming and they eventually decided that the region should be depopulated and the forests replanted.<br><br>By exploring the history of an eighteen-county region, Robert Gough illustrates the travails of farming in "marginal" areas. He juxtaposes the social history of the farmers with the opinions and programs of the experts who sought to improve the region, and shows how what occurred in the Wisconsin cutover anticipated the sweeping changes that would transform American agriculture after World War II. <i>Farming the Cutover</i> is a readable story of the hopes and failures of people who struggled to build new lives in an inhospitable environment. It makes an important counterpoint to Turnerian myths and the more commonly-told success stories of farming history.</p><p>This is the story of Lawrence Svobida, a Kansas wheat farmer who fought searing drought, wind, erosion, and economic hard times in the Dust Bowl. It is a vivid account by a farmer who pitted his physical strength, mental faculties, and financial resources against the environment as nature wreaked havoc across the southern Great Plains. Svobida&#39;s description of Dust Bowl agriculture is important not only because it accurately describes farming in that region but also because it is one of the few first-hand accounts that remain of the frightening and still haunting dust-laden decade of the 1930&#39;s.R.

On 9 July 1755 amid the wilderness of North America, Britain suffered one of the most humiliating defeats in her history. General Braddock&#39;s army, a mixture of British regulars and American militia, was shattered, losing over 900 men from a force of 1,300. Braddock was killed and the remnants of his army rescued by his aide, Colonel George Washington. The origins of this defeat can be traced back to the death of a junior French officer little more than a year before in a relatively minor skirmish with a party of Virginian militia commanded by the same George Washington.

Questioning how design can improve daily lives, editors Bryan Bell and Katie Wakeford map an emerging geography of architectural activism--or "public-interest architecture"--that might function akin to public-interest law or medicine by expanding architecture's all too often elite client base. With 30 essays by practicing architects and designers, urban and community planners, historians, landscape architects, environmental designers and members of other fields, this volume presents recent work from around the world that illustrates the ways in which design can address issues of social justice.</p><p>" Any form of development that is to be sustainable has to optimize ecology, economy, and social equity. New models for design and practice--like the inspiring ones in this book--are integrating these realms in ways that can create catalysts for a positive future." William A. McDonough, FAIA William McDonough + Partners <p>" This collection of exemplary works should become the subject of continuing education for every architect and required of every student early in his or her academic experience. It provides us with a primer for our conscience and meaning for our work." Marvin J. Malecha, FAIA, DPACSA Dean, NC State University College of Design 2009 AIA President</p><p>"...This visually rich book, (published by Metropolis Books) is an inspiring read for anyone, but its clear and instructive descriptions also make it a reference book of sorts for those interested in acting through architecture... </p><p>This book presents diverse examples of architectural projects directed towards the greater public good, in stories told from the perspectives of the architects. The stories aren't about the individuals themselves, but about their experiences. As they discuss projects that range from a public transit shelter in a disadvantaged neighborhood to new dwellings in a rural part of Taiwan, each designer describes the design process, challenges they faced and the proposed solutions... </p><p>Expanding Architecture is arranged into eight chapters of various topics that allow designers of all interests to relate. As a professional designer, I found it easy to be inspired by a project. What I found extremely helpful was that this book offered guidance on how to proceed with projects in a similar way to those described, showing me exactly how I could make a difference myself. The architects profiled discuss their processes step by step, telling what worked and the actions they took. It's wonderful to have a collection of stories that so strongly makes this point, by showing the broad array of projects that are already making a difference, and hopefully inspiring more like them in the future.</p></p><h2>Workholding for Machinists (Crowood Metalworking Guides)</h2><p>As well as covering the various workholding options, this book explains the principles behind them. It explains the importance of precision in holding work in place, and also the importance of tools and machines being held securely, so that the machinist may avoid damage to the machine and to the work being undertaken, and thus achieve a high quality end product. The emphasis is on creating good work within a limited budget, and a limited range of resources. The topics covered in this new book include work holding on lathes and milling machines, collets and collect chucks, turning between centers, turning on a faceplate, and tool holding.</p><p><b>Tim Stevens </b>was apprenticed as a silversmith, and has worked in the jewelry trade, in car and motorcycle manufacture, and as a technical college lecturer.

Despite being overshadowed by the Napoleonic Wars raging in Europe, the War of 1812 saw Americans, British, Canadians, and Native Americans wage an increasing brutal conflict all along the border.</p><p>By 1814, with war coming to a close in Europe, the Americans decided to launch one last, major land offensive in an attempt to seize Canada. Although previous attempts had most often ended in disaster, the American army of 1814 contained several highly trained units under competent leadership including the legendary Winfield Scott. This final Niagara campaign saw a number of pitched battles including Chippawa, Lundy's Lane, and Cook's Mill, where the American Bluecoats matched the British shot for shot. However, due to poor planning at the highest levels of American office, the campaign was ultimately a failure and the result ensured the survival of Canada as an independent state. </p><p>A critically-acclaimed researcher on the War of 1812, author John Latimer presents a new look at an oft-forgotten yet crucially important campaign in the history of North America.</p></p><p>Jon Latimer lives in Swansea where he studied Oceanography, and after a varied career in environmental science now writes full-time. Jon also served for 17 years in the Territorial Army, including an attachment to the Australian Army Reserve. He has already written Campaign 73: Operation Compass 1940 for Osprey. He is also the author of The Art of Deception in War.&#x201c;Overall, this is a well written volume, which would be a useful addition to any collection on that period, providing the reader with a large breadth of information in a very digestible format.

We know the greatest hits, but celebrated author Robert Gordon takes us to the people and places history has yet to record. A Memphis native, he whiles away time in a crumbling duplex with blues legend Furry Lewis, stays up late with barrelhouse piano player Mose Vinson, and sips homemade whiskey at Junior Kimbrough's churning house parties. A passionate listener, he hears modern times deep in the grooves of old records by Lead Belly and Robert Johnson.</p><p>The interconnected profiles and stories in <i>Memphis Rent Party</i> convey more than a region. Like mint seeping into bourbon, Gordon gets into the wider world. He beholds the beauty of mistakes with producer Jim Dickinson (Replacements, Rolling Stones), charts the stars with Alex Chilton (Box Tops, Big Star), and mulls the tragedy of Jeff Buckley's fatal swim. Gordon's Memphis inspires Cat Power, attracts Townes Van Zandt, and finds James Carr always singing at the dark end of the street. </p><p>A rent party is when friends come together to hear music, dance, and help a pal through hard times; it's a celebration in the face of looming tragedy, an optimism when the wolf is at the door.

Wooton, the Anniversary Professor of History at the University of York, explores primary texts and detailed history to build his argument that Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe&#x2019;s discovery of a new star in 1572 started a scientific revolution, and that Isaac Newton&#x2019;s 1704 publication of <em>Opticks</em> sealed it. What happened in between was a series of discoveries&#x2014;of gunpowder, movable type, the New World, etc.&#x2014;that altered our perception of <em>what is</em> and, through the Newtonian Revolution, opened our minds to <em>what might be</em>. The sheer size of the book allows readers to jump around between essays, but taken as a whole <em>The Invention of Science</em> builds a powerful, thoroughly fascinating argument ripe for debate. --<em>Chris Schluep</em></p><p>We live in a world made by science. How and when did this happen? <em>The Invention of Science</em> tells the story of the extraordinary intellectual and cultural revolution that gave birth to modern science, and mounts a major challenge to the prevailing orthodoxy of its history.</p><p>Before 1492, all significant knowledge was believed to be already available; there was no concept of progress, as people looked to the past, not the future, for understanding. David Wootton argues that the discovery of America demonstrated that new knowledge was possible: indeed, it introduced the very concept of discovery and opened the way to the invention of science.</p><p>The first crucial discovery was Tycho Brahe&#x2019;s nova of 1572: proof that there could be change in the heavens. The invention of the telescope in 1608 rendered the old astronomy obsolete. Evangelista Torricelli&#x2019;s experiment with the vacuum in 1643 led directly to the triumph of the experimental method in the Royal Society of Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton. By 1750, Newtonianism was being celebrated throughout Europe.</p><p>This new science did not consist simply of new discoveries or methods. It relied on a new understanding of what knowledge may be, and with this came a fresh language: <em>discovery</em>, <em>progress</em>, <em>fact</em>, <em>experiment</em>, <em>hypothesis</em>, <em>theory</em>, <em>laws of nature</em>. Although almost all these terms existed before 1492, their meanings were radically transformed, and they became tools to think scientifically. Now we all speak this language of science that was invented during the Scientific Revolution.</p><p>This revolution had its martyrs (Bruno, Galileo), its heroes (Kepler, Boyle), its propagandists (Voltaire, Diderot), and its patient laborers (Gilbert, Hooke). The new culture led to a new rationalism, killing off alchemy, astrology, and the belief in witchcraft. It also led to the invention of the steam engine and to the first Industrial Revolution. Wootton&#x2019;s landmark work changes our understanding of how this great transformation came about, and of what science is.</p></p><h2>The Bible in Political Debate: What Does it Really Say?</h2><p><p>Politicians and pundits regularly invoke the Bible in social and political debates on a host of controversial social and political issues, including: abortion, stem-cell research, gay marriage, the death penalty, separation of church and state, family values, climate change, income distribution, teaching evolution in schools, taxation, school prayer, aid for the poor, and immigration. But is the Bible often used out of context in these major debates?</p><p>This book includes essays by fourteen biblical scholars who examine the use of the Bible in political debates, uncovering the original historical contexts and meanings of the biblical verses that are commonly cited. The contributors take a non-confessional approach, rooted in non-partisan scholarship, to show how specific texts have at times been distorted in order to support particular views. At the same time, they show how the Bible can sometimes make for unsettling reading in the modern day. The key questions remain: What does the Bible really say? Should the Bible be used to form public policy?</p></p><p><p><b>Frances Flannery</b> is Director at the Center for the Interdisciplinary Study of Terrorism and Peace, and Professor of Religion at James Madison University, USA.<br><b></b><br><b>Rodney A.

In this accessible, vibrant collection of essays, nonpartisan Biblical scholars of many creeds, including nonbelievers, examine what the Bible really says about family values, women's rights, homosexuality, abortion and even how to deal with man-caused climate change, and present some surprising answers to the vital question of how and whether the Bible can be the basis of the secular nation's public policy." - <i>Nina Burleigh, National Politics Correspondent, Newsweek Magazine</i></p><p>" The essays in this book confront head on without apology the complicated and thorny relationship that Americans have with the Bible from the first colonizers who saw themselves as the 'city on the hill' to the First Amendment and the establishment of a 'wall of separation' between church and state. It sets up for us a series of difficult questions. How could both slavers and abolitionists use the Bible to bolster their positions? How could the Bible be used to justify keeping women from the vote as well as supporting their bid to vote? How have people of opposite opinions used the Bible to argue that God is on their side? A powerful book that puts us at the center of the storm." - <i>April DeConick, Rice University, USA</i></p><p>"This fine book colors in what others have only sketched out - the Bible's constant presence beside and impact on the American experience. It is an insightful look at how the politics of the past are not so different from the politics of now, especially when viewed through the lens of the Bible." - <i>Kimberly Winston, Religion News Service</i></p><p>"This book is for readers of any faith or no faith who have eber heard politicians, pundits, or prophets justify their positions with appeals to scripture and wondered, 'Does the Bible really say that?' Here, Biblical scholars go about exploring that question in ways that are illuminating, surprising and provocative. Their essays combine top-notch research and much needed candor with sensitivity and wit." - <i>Mark Chancey, Southern Methodist University, USA</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"An engaging volume.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Bible Today</i><br><i></i></p></p><h2>Chronicles Of Wormwood: The Last Enemy</h2><p><ul> <li><i>The Chronicles of Wormwood</i> continues in this all-new original graphic novel that picks up right after the original trade paperback!

When the Tuckers' next door neighbor mentions someone rang their doorbell late the previous night, Sarah and Kenny Tucker check their home's security camera and discover something shocking: the doorbell ringer also visited their house and it wasn't a teenager playing a prank, but instead a terrified young woman with a shackle hanging from her right wrist. She anxiously pressed the doorbell again and again, glancing over her shoulder as if someone was coming for her, before giving up and taking off into the dark. Almost overnight, she becomes known as The Girl on the Porch&#x2014;and she's everywhere. There are updates on all the local networks, national coverage on CNN and Fox News, and the video goes viral on social media. Before long, everyone has seen the harrowing security camera footage. Kenny and Sarah figure it's only a matter of time before someone recognizes the woman, but as the days pass and no one comes forward, odd things begin to transpire around the Tucker family: a man intensely watches them at a restaurant and then vanishes, fresh footprints appear in the garden next to their house where no one should have been, a neighbor's pet is viciously killed and mutilated, and a mysterious man has started following their daughter Natalie...

The challenges and difficulties they face seem all the larger for their frequent lack of mentors and friends with whom to discuss these issues. <p>Yet, according to Willimon, a "cloud of witnesses" surrounds those in ordained ministry, forebears from whom they could learn if they had the opportunity to listen. The challenges and joys of ministry are not new; they have been present since the first Christian congregations began. From the age of the church fathers and mothers, into the Middle Ages, through the Reformation, and down to the present, faithful leaders of the Christian Church have contemplated, debated, laughed, and prayed about the life of ordained leadership. </p><p>In this new volume Willimon brings together the best voices from 20 centuries of Christian pastors and leaders, introducing what they have to say on the tasks and roles of ministry. Brief, accessible excerpts from the most important writings on ordained ministry encourage today's pastors. Each introduction places the excerpt in the context of its own time and place, then discusses its particular relevance for the practice of ministry today. This volume will serve as a guide to all who seek the wisdom of those who have followed the call to ordained ministry before them.</p></p><p>Feeling most at home behind a pulpit, Will Willimon&#x2019;s deepest calling is to be a preacher and truth-teller of Jesus Christ.

As a pollster, he was taught that people vote for candidates on the basis of the candidates' positions on issues. But his initial polls for Reagan revealed something fascinating: Voters who didn't agree with Reagan on the issues still wanted to vote for him. Mystified, Wirthlin studied the matter further. He discovered just what made people want to vote for Reagan.1<br>&nbsp;<br>Reagan talked about values rather than issues. Communicating values mattered more than specific policy positions. Reagan connected with people; he communicated well. Reagan also appeared authentic--he seemed to believe what he said. And because he talked about his values, connected with people, and appeared authentic, they felt they could trust him.<br>&nbsp;<br>For these four reasons--values, connection, authenticity, and trust--voters identified with Reagan; they felt he was one of them. It was not because all of his values matched theirs exactly. It was not because he was from their socioeconomic class or subculture. It was because they believed in the integrity of his connection with them as well as the connection between his worldview and his actions.<br>&nbsp;<br>Issues are real, as are the facts of the matter. But issues are also symbolic of values and of trustworthiness. Effective campaigns must communicate the candidates' values and use issues symbolically--as indicative of their moral values and their trustworthiness.<br>&nbsp;<br>Recall Reagan's mythical Cadillac-driving "welfare queen." For Reagan, she represented more than just a case of welfare abuse. She came to symbolize all that was wrong with the government's approach to dealing with poverty, especially a wide array of government "handouts"--programs he thought rewarded laziness, removed the incentive to be disciplined, and promoted immorality.<br>&nbsp;<br>Whatever we may think of Reagan, this has been a winning formula for conservatives for the past quarter century. Progressives need to learn from it. Politics is about values; it is about communication; it is about voters trusting a candidate to do what is right; it is about believing in, and identifying with, a candidate's worldview. And it is about symbolism.<br>&nbsp;<br>Issues are secondary--not irrelevant or unimportant, but secondary. A position on issues should follow from one's values, and the choice of issues and policies should symbolize those values.<br>&nbsp;<br>One misunderstanding, common among progressive circles, is that the Reagan and George W. Bush elections were about "personality" rather than anything substantive. Nothing is more substantive than a candidate's moral worldview--and whether he or she authentically abides by it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Wirthlin's discovery happened to be about a presidential candidate, but it applies much more broadly. It should be taken to heart by all progressives: Concentrate on values and principles. Be authentic; stand up for what you really believe. Empathize and connect with the people you are talking to, on the basis of identity--their identity and yours.<br>&nbsp;<br>This book is not about winning and losing elections. It is about winning and losing hearts and minds. This can happen only by helping people discover who they truly are in their heart of hearts.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is about values and how to communicate them. It is about what a progressive vision is, about what fundamental progressive moral values and principles are, and about how one can articulate them and argue persuasively in favor of them. The secret is effective communication--the use of words and language in the service of our deepest convictions.<br>&nbsp;<br>Progressives have not only failed to understand Wirthlin's discovery, they have also not understood recent advances in cognitive science, so they continue to fall into a number of traps. These are traps of our own making, however, and we can get out of them without having to change anything about our values.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is cause for optimism. The purpose of this handbook is to lay out the anatomy of progressive values, ideas, and arguments to free us from traps we have fallen into.<br>&nbsp;<br>TWELVE TRAPS TO AVOID<br>&nbsp;<br>1. The Issue Trap. We hear it said all the time: Progressives won't unite behind any set of ideas. We all have different ideas and care about different issues. The truth is that progressives do agree at the level of values and that there is a real basis for progressive unity. Progressive values cut across issues. So do principles and forms of argument. Conservatives argue conservatism, no matter what the issue. Progressives should argue progressivism. We need to get out of issue silos that isolate arguments and keep us from the values and principles that define an overall progressive vision.<br>&nbsp;<br>2. The Poll Trap. Many progressives slavishly follow polls. The job of leaders is to lead, not follow. Besides, contrary to popular belief, polls in themselves do not present accurate empirical evidence. Polls are only as accurate as the framing of their questions, which is often inadequate. Real leaders don't use polls to find out what positions to take; they lead people to new positions.<br>&nbsp;<br>3. The Laundry List Trap. Progressives tend to believe that people vote on the basis of lists of programs and policies. In fact, people vote based on values, connection, authenticity, trust, and identity.<br>&nbsp;<br>4. The Rationalism Trap. There is a commonplace--and false--theory that reason is completely conscious, literal (applies directly to the objective world), logical, universal, and unemotional. Cognitive science has shown that every one of these assumptions is false. These assumptions lead progressives into other traps: assuming that hard facts will persuade voters, that voters are "rational" and vote in their self-interest and on the issues, and that negating a frame is an effective way to argue against it.<br>&nbsp;<br>5. The No-Framing-Necessary Trap. Progressives often argue that "truth doesn't need to be framed" and that the "facts speak for themselves." People use frames--deep-seated mental structures about how the world works--to understand facts. Frames are in our brains and define our common sense. It is impossible to think or communicate without activating frames, and so which frame is activated is of crucial importance. Truths need to be framed appropriately to be seen as truths. Facts need a context.<br>&nbsp;<br>6. The Policies-Are-Values Trap. Progressives regularly mistake policies with values, which are ethical ideas like empathy, responsibility, fairness, freedom, justice, and so on. Policies are not themselves values, though they are, or should be, based on values. Thus, Social Security and universal health insurance are not values; they are policies meant to reflect and codify the values of human dignity, the common good, fairness, and equality.<br>&nbsp;<br>7. The Centrist Trap. There is a common belief that there is an ideological "center"--a large group of voters either with a consistent ideology of their own or lined up left to right on the issues or forming a "mainstream," all with the same positions on issues. In fact, the so-called center is actually made up of biconceptuals, people who are conservative in some aspects of life and progressive in others. Voters who self-identify as "conservative" often have significant progressive values in important areas of life. We should address these "partial progressive" biconceptuals through their progressive identities, which are often systematic and extensive.<br>&nbsp;<br>A common mistaken ideology has convinced many progressives that they must "move to the right" to get more votes. In reality, this is counterproductive. By moving to the right, progressives actually help activate the right's values and give up on their own. In the process, they also alienate their base.<br>&nbsp;<br>8. The "Misunderestimating" Trap. Too many progressives think that people who vote conservative are just stupid, especially those who vote against their economic self-interest. <br>&nbsp;<br>Progressives believe that we only have to tell them the real economic facts, and they will change the way they vote. The reality is that those who vote conservative have their reasons, and we had better understand them. Conservative populism is cultural--not economic--in nature. Conservative populists see themselves as oppressed by elitist liberals who look down their noses at them, when they are just ordinary, moral, right-thinking folks. They see liberals as trying to impose an immoral "political correctness" on them, and they are angry about it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Progressives also paint conservative leaders as incompetent and not very smart, based on a misunderstanding of the conservative agenda. This results from looking at conservative goals through progressive values. Looking at conservative goals through conservative values yields insight and shows just how effective conservatives really are.2<br>&nbsp;<br>9. The Reactive Trap. For the most part, we have been letting conservatives frame the debate. Conservatives are taking the initiative on policy making and getting their ideas out to the public. When progressives react, we echo the conservative frames and values, so our message is not heard or, even worse, reinforces their ideas. Progressives need a collection of proactive policies and communication techniques to get our own values out on our own terms. "War rooms" and "truth squads" must change frames, not reinforce conservative frames. But even then, they are not nearly enough. Progressive leaders, outside of any party, must come together in an ongoing, long-term, organized national campaign that honestly conveys progressive values to the public--day after day, week after week, year after year, no matter what the specific issues of the day are.<br>&nbsp;<br>10. The Spin Trap. Some progressives believe that winning elections or getting public support is a matter of clever spin and catchy...</p><h2>Creation of the New</h2><p>"Creation of the New" is a post-apocalyptic vision for our times. Imagery and metaphor best describe "Creation of the New." Its words reflect the powerful effects brought forth by its author Mari Perron. Her authentic mystical voice is reminiscent of Mechtild of Magdeburg; at once feminine and supremely intelligent. "Creation" introduces a post-apocalyptic era. Perron is not hesitant to use apocalyptic language, or to acknowledge the apocalyptic nature of the times in which we live, yet her emphasis is upon the prophetic announcement of the birth of the new &#x201c;Babe,&#x201d; the &#x201c;jewel of humanity&#x201d; hidden in the obvious. Creation&#x2019;s message is of imminent importance in these turbulent and painful times. As we each experience the apocalypse with ourselves &#x2013; as the death of the old and birth of the new &#x2013; the same crisis of death and rebirth is occurring in the world. It is in progress. Our awareness and embrace of this transformational time is crucial to keeping &#x201c;the burning Cause of hope alive within the heart when no cause is left for hope.&#x201d;</p><p>Mari Perron has spent the past sixteen years exploring the realm of the heart through receptive and creative mystical experiences. She is also a mother and grandmother who draws on the divine feminine and sees its relation to the coming of a new age; to embodying the sacred, and to recognizing, caring for, and relating to the sacred in all that lives.</p><h2>CLASSICS TO MODERNS BOOK 1 PIANO</h2><p>Classics to Moderns</p><p></p><h2>Aimee &amp; Jaguar: A Love Story, Berlin 1943</h2><p><p>Berlin 1942. Lilly Wust, twenty-nine, married, four children, led a life as did millions of German women. But then she met the twenty-one-year-old Felice Schragenheim.</p><p>It was love almost at first sight. Aim�e (Lilly) and Jaguar (Felice) started forging plans for the future. They composed poems and love letters to each other, and wrote their own marriage contract. When Jaguar admitted to her lover that she was Jewish, this dangerous secret drew the two women even closer to each other. But their luck didn't last. On August 21, 1944, Jaguar was arrested and deported.</p><p>At the age of eighty, Lilly Wust told her story to Erica Fischer, who turned it into a poignant testimony. After the book appeared in 1994 she was contacted by additional contemporaries of Aim�e and Jaguar who offered new material that has been integrated into the present edition.</p><p>The book, translated into twenty languages, and the film based on it&#x2014;directed by Max F�rberb�ck, with Juliane K�hler and Maria Schrader in the leading roles&#x2014;have made Aim�e and Jaguar's story known around the world.</p></p><p>Acclaimed in Germany and England, this tragic and remarkable real-life love story won a Lambda Literary Award when it was first published in America in 1995. Lilly Wust ("Aim�e") was a conventional middle-class mother of four, estranged from her philandering husband, when she met Felice Schragenheim ("Jaguar") in 1941. Their passionate affair unfolded against the backdrop of the deportation of Jews from Berlin, but several months passed before Felice could even bring herself to tell Lilly that she was Jewish and living illegally on the streets. "I knew, of course, what it meant," Lilly recalled in old age. "Not for a moment did I think that I too could be in danger. On the contrary, all I wanted to do now was to save her." Lilly's heroic efforts to conceal and protect Felice through the next two years make for painful and inspiring reading. Felice was arrested in August 1944 and sent her last letter to Lilly four months later. In 1981 Lilly was awarded the German Federal Service Cross, though no one could read this as a happy ending. <i>--Regina Marler</i><p>Erica Fischer was born in 1943 in England.

Hands-on exercises, step-by-step instructions for ceremonies, and sketches by the author&#39;s wife explain how to clear spaces of unwanted energy, create simple ceremonies, connect with spirit guides and angels, and interpret symbols. An extended discussion tells how to make a medicine wheel that resembles a labyrinth and use it as an engine for distance healing. Additional ceremonies for daily living, healing the earth, and soul retrieval are also described, and the spiritual quest itself is shown to follow the process of choosing a sacred place in nature, finding a sacred place within oneself, and connecting to the inner and outer worlds.

Versluis has distilled an immense amount of scholarship into this small volume, but its brevity is deceiving. Like the culmination to any alchemical work, _Perennial Philosophy_ is a powerful tincture that-once imbibed-transports receptive readers to a world in which they are part of a spiritual hierarchy that links heaven to earth. Arthur Versluis has distilled an immense amount of scholarship to produce a disarmingly accessible, lucid, and deeply penetrating study of the great philosophic traditions that underlie Western culture. Versluis concisely explains what perennial philosophy is and what it isn&#39;t. The clarity of his prose makes this deep book a pleasure to read. A remarkable achievement! -Gregory Shaw, author of _Theurgy and the Soul: The Neoplatonism of Iamblichus_</p><p>Arthur Versluis holds a doctorate from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and has published numerous books and articles. Among his books are _Magic and Mysticism: An Introduction to Western Esotericism_ (Rowman Littlefield, 2007), _The New Inquisitions: Heretic-hunting and the Intellectual Origins of Modern Totalitarianism_ (Oxford UP, 2006), _Restoring Paradise: Esoteric Transmission through Literature and Art_ (SUNY: 2004); _The Esoteric Origins of the American Renaissance_ (Oxford UP: 2001); _Wisdom&#39;s Book: The Sophia Anthology_, (Paragon House, 2000); _Wisdom&#39;s Children: A Christian Esoteric Tradition_ (SUNY: 1999); and _American Transcendentalism and Asian Religions_ (Oxford UP, 1993). His family has owned a commercial farm in West Michigan for several generations, and so he also published _Island Farm_, a book about the family farm and about family farming in the modern era.</p><h2>Master of the Three Ways: Reflections of a Chinese Sage on Living a Satisfying Life</h2><p>At once profound, spiritual, and witty, <i>Master of the Three Ways</i> is a remarkable work about human nature, the essence of life, and how to live simply and with awareness. In three hundred and fifty-seven verses, the author, Hung Ying-ming&#x2014;a seventeenth-century Chinese sage&#x2014;explores good and evil, honesty and deception, wisdom and foolishness, and heaven and hell. He draws from the wisdom of the &#x201c;Three Creeds&#x201d;&#x2014;Taoism, Confucianism, and Zen Buddhism&#x2014;to impress upon us that by combining simple elegance with the ordinary, we can make our lives artistic and poetic. This sense, along with a particular understanding of Zen that makes art from the simple in everyday life, has permeated Chinese and Japanese culture to this day. <br><br>The work is divided into two books. The first generally deals with the art of living in society and the second is concerned with man's solitude and contemplations of nature. These themes repeatedly spill over into each other, creating multiple levels of meaning.</p><p>William Scott Wilson is the foremost translator into English of traditional Japanese texts on samurai culture.

At the same time, his thought is rooted in the experience of the early Christian centuries. The result is a book that sees humanity in fundamentally spiritual terms.<p>Clement begins by exploring a response to the dysfunctional aspects of nature, and then looks at how we are persons made in the image of the divine and in communion with one another; in the light of what emerges, the author discovers fresh understandings of sexuality, politics, the role of humanity in the cosmos and the power of beauty; his discussion ends with facing our society's unmentionable question: death.</p><p>Here is a fine book for all explorers into the deeper meaning of what it is to be human.</p></p><p>n/a'This short treatise offers a wonderful synthesis of systematic and mystical theology, though it may not satisfy Western theologians looking for more rigorous, philosophical grounding. Its evocative texture, peppered with wisdom from the patristic tradition, invites the reader to contemplative speculation. The English translation has a vigorous, poetic style that makes it highly readable.... The chapters on eros and human sexuality, on persons in communion, and on political theology ... are so rich that the reader will inevitably be drawn to Clement's earlier <i>The Roots of Christian Mysticism.'</i> --Patrick Howell SJ, <i>Theological Studies</i><br><br>'Having fed on Clement's <i>The Roots of Christian Mysticism</i> and <i>Three Prayers</i>, I was delighted to discover this work.... [Clement] is at once contemporary, visionary, and thoroughly rooted in tradition. Reading him is a wonderful preparation for prayer.' --David M. Denny, <i>Desert Call</i></p><h2>Mormon Rebellion</h2><p>In 1857 President James Buchanan ordered U.S. troops to Utah to replace Brigham Young as governor and restore order in what the federal government viewed as a territory in rebellion. In this compelling narrative, award-winning authors David L. Bigler and Will Bagley use long-suppressed sources to show that&#x2014;contrary to common perception&#x2014;the Mormon rebellion was not the result of Buchanan's "blunder," nor was it a David-and-Goliath tale in which an abused religious minority heroically defied the imperial ambitions of an unjust and tyrannical government. They argue that Mormon leaders had their own far-reaching ambitions and fully intended to establish an independent nation&#x2014;the Kingdom of God&#x2014;in the West.<p></p><p>Long overshadowed by the Civil War, the tragic story of this conflict involved a tense and protracted clash pitting Brigham Young's Nauvoo Legion against Colonel Albert Sidney Johnston and the U.S. Army's Utah Expedition. In the end, the conflict between the two armies saw no pitched battles, but in the authors' view, Buchanan's decision to order troops to Utah, his so-called blunder, eventually proved decisive and beneficial for both Mormons and the American republic.</p><p>A rich exploration of events and forces that presaged the Civil War, <i>The Mormon Rebellion </i>broadens our understanding of both antebellum America and Utah's frontier theocracy and offers a challenging reinterpretation of a controversial chapter in Mormon annals.</p></p><p>Independent historian<b> David L.

The <i>Treatise</i> is the first true philosophical expression of dandyism, and is full of well-crafted aphorisms: &#x201c;Elegant living is, in the broad acceptance of the term, the art of animating repose,&#x201d; runs one classic definition of dandyism, and &#x201c;One must have studied at least as far as rhetoric to lead an elegant life&#x201d; asserts the importance of verbal pirouette and dexterous quipping to the dandy. Further embellished with anecdotes and historical and personal illustrations, Balzac's <i>Treatise</i> even features a fictitious encounter with the original dandy himself, Beau Brummell. Never before translated into English, this witty tract makes for an illuminating cornerstone to Balzac's <i>Human Comedy</i> (which was originally to have included a never-completed four-part philosophical &#x201c;Pathology of Social Life&#x201d;). Above all, it represents a decisive moment in the history of dandyism, and an entertaining exposition on the profundities of what lies deepest within all of us: our appearance.</p><p></p><h2>Because God Loves Stories: An Anthology of Jewish Storytelling</h2><p><b>An exciting new treasury of Jewish stories and storytellers, from ancient tales and classics re-imagined to contemporary family stories, parables, and humor</b> <br> "Why were human beings created?" goes a traditional Jewish saying.

As with his debut, <i>The Final Voicemails</i> brushes up against the pain, fear, and isolation that accompany a long illness, but with all the creative force of an artist in full command of his craft and the teeming affection of a human utterly in love with the world.<br><br> The representation of the end of life resists simplicity here. It is physical decay, but it is also tedium. It is alchemy, &#x201c;the breaking apart, / the replacement of who, when, how, and where, / with what.&#x201d; It is an antagonist&#x2015;and it is a part of the self. Ritvo&#x2019;s poems ring with considered reflection on the enduring final question, while suggesting&#x2015;in their vibrancy and their humor&#x2015;that death is not merely an end.<br><br> <i>The Final Voicemails</i> is an ecstatic, hopeful, painful&#x2015;and completely breathtaking&#x2015;second collection.</p><p><b>Max Ritvo</b> (1990&#x2013;2016) was the author of <i>Four Reincarnations</i> and the chapbook <i>Aeons</i>, chosen by Jean Valentine to receive the Poetry Society of America Chapbook Fellowship in 2014.

Now, they have turned their focus to nonfiction, identifying a wide range of mentor texts and showing how these models illustrate the key features of good writing. &nbsp; Lynne and Rose guide teachers through a variety of projects, samples, and classroom anecdotes that demonstrate how teachers can help students become more effective writers of good nonfiction.&nbsp;The Your Turn lessons at the end of each chapter use the gradual release of responsibility model to guide and empower student writers. Teachers will find especially helpful the information on how to select appropriate mentor texts from among the sometimes overwhelming offerings of children&#x2019;s literature. Each Your Turn lesson encourages reflection and motivates students to think about what they&#x2019;ve learned, the purpose of learning and practicing a skill or strategy, and how they might use this technique in the future. Additionally, <i>An Author&#x2019;s Voice</i> provides encouragement and advice from published authors of children&#x2019;s nonfiction.&nbsp; &nbsp; One of the most valuable features of <i>Nonfiction Mentor Texts</i> is the treasure chest of books organized according to chapter. This list includes every title mentioned in the book, as well as a host of other titles that teachers can use to help students learn about quality nonfiction writing&#x2014;building content, organizing text, developing voice, enhancing style, using punctuation effectively&#x2014;and from which students can draw topic ideas. Lynne and Rose have either read or used all of the featured books in their classrooms and have selected titles that meet the needs of students at varying levels. Teachers will be able to find the just-right book for each student.</p><p><p>Lynne, a native of Philadelphia, received her bachelor's and master's degrees in elementary education, her supervisory certificate in elementary education, her reading specialist certificate from LaSalle University, and her educational leadership doctorate degree from Immaculata University. She has thirty-eight years' of experience with the Upper Moreland School District and 25 years of experience gathered in course work and presentation work for the Pennsylvania Writing &amp; Literature Project.</p><p>She became a teacher because "I wanted to make a difference and I love working with kids." Like many others, she also "played school" as a child. "I had some great teachers and I wanted to be like them. Especially, Mrs. Steinberg, my sixth grade teacher. There were over 30 kids in my class that year. Mrs. Steinberg was the first teacher who held writing conferences and encouraged us to write for real world audiences. I remember sharing 'My Most Unforgettable Character' with my riding instructor, Mick Warmington. I remember his face while he was reading it. I still get chills when I think about it. That's when I realized the power of the written word. That's when I first dreamed about writing and publishing books and encouraging my future students to do the same."</p><p>Lynne is currently literacy a Co-director of the Pennsylvania Writing and Literature Project; adjunct professor for Arcadia University; and a legacy ambassador/tour guide for Pearl S. Buck International. She also does independent consulting work for the PA Writing Project and serves on the board for Chester County Reading Association as well as the board for Eta Chapter of Alpha Delta Kappa. For the past six years, Lynne has facilitated a senior citizen writing group for Upper Moreland Township through Upper Moreland School District.</p><p>Her latest book is a collaborative work with her colleague, Diane Dougherty. It targets grades K-6 and demonstrates how to embed grammar and mechanics instruction throughout the day. "We think that grammar matters, but we don't believe in workbooks and isolated lessons. We think the teaching of grammar should be both explicit and implicit. Every day teachers need to tuck in grammar and mechanics wherever and whenever it is applicable. That means your modeling or discussion might occur in social studies as easily as it might occur in writing and reading workshop."</p><p>Lynne co-authored three books with friend and colleague, Rose Cappelli. "We based everything on classroom samples and our work with children. An important part was including anecdotes--advice we received from Shelley Harwayne. It helped to keep a notebook of our ideas."</p><p>Lynne describes her approach to professional development as hands on and interactive, using the gradual release of responsibility model. "Very practical and user-friendly--let's take it right back to the classroom."</p><p>Lynne has two goddaughters and three Welsh Corgi dogs. She recently acquired a husband, Ralph, who has the patience of a saint. "He supports me in all my endeavors and is my best friend." Lynne loves to plant flowers, read books, write poetry, and spend time at the seashore with her husband, friends, and goddaughters. She taught herself how to play the guitar and loves the old folk songs written by Peter, Paul, and Mary and Pete Seeger. She especially loves the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Rod Stewart, James Taylor, Simon and Garfunkel, Jim Morrison, and Gordon Lightfoot.</p>"Chock-full of great ideas." - Reading Lady blog<br></p><h2>Children and Environmental Toxins: What Everyone Needs to Know�</h2><p>More than 80,000 new chemicals have been developed and released into the global environment during the last four decades. Today the World Health Organization attributes more than one-third of all childhood deaths to environmental causes, and as rates of childhood disease skyrocket -- autism, asthma, ADHD, obesity, diabetes, and even birth defects -- it raises serious, difficult questions around how the chemical environment is impacting children's health.<br><br><em>Children and Environmental Toxins: What Everyone Needs to Know�</em> offers an accessible guide to understanding and identifying the potential sources of harm in a child's environment. Written by experts in pediatrics and environmental health and formatted in an easy to follow question-and-answer format, it offers parents, care providers, and activists a reliable introduction to a hotly debated topic. <br><br>As the burdens of environmental toxins and disease continue to defy borders, this book provides a new benchmark to understanding the potential threats in our environment and food.

Can the ugly, corrupt side of sports counteract their potential to deepen our moral lives and make a positive impact? <br><br>This accessible book tackles a wide-ranging array of topics that arise in ethics of sport on every level, from amateur to professional, and from the general to the specific. <br><br>Ethics of sport expert Robert Simon examines provocative, thorny questions throughout the book: Why do we care so much about sports? Do sports embody special values that social function views fail to grasp? Are such values good or bad? What counts as overemphasizing winning? Should winning be important in youth sports? What makes cheating in sports ethically objectionable? Is trash-talking cheating? How have performance enhancing drugs affected sport? Can we distinguish them from other advances that enhance performance, such as technological improvements in equipment? Should contact sports be modified to protect the health of athletes? Do organized athletics belong in schools? Don't athletic programs undermine academics in secondary and college education? Would it be better to separate sports and education, so schools focus on academics? Do sports undermine or reinforce gender equity? Why do so many elite athletes misbehave? How have professional sports affected minority groups and the underprivileged? Is money ruining elite sport? <br><br>Simon's short exploration of the ethics of sports, which unfolds in this series' distinctive question-and-answer format, will interest sports enthusiasts, those who seek to understand the ethical controversies in sport even from an outsider's perspective, and students of applied ethics who need a primer on sports ethics in particular.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robert L.

He is a past president of the International Association for the Philosophy of Sport and a recipient of its Distinguished Scholar award. He also was head golf coach for 14 years at Hamilton College and his teams participated in national championships.<br><br>Robert Simon's <em>The Ethics of Sport</em> raises serious questions about honesty, fairness, expectations of excellence, the value of competition, and the role of sports in contemporary society. Simon treats these issues and many more in a manner that is carefully balanced and illuminating of issues far beyond sports themselves." --<strong>Leslie P. Francis</strong>, Distinguished Professor of Law and Philosophy, Alfred C. Emery Professor of Law, and Associate Dean for Faculty Research and Development in the College of Law, University of Utah<p></p><br>"An easy-to-read analysis of ethics by one of the world's most highly respected sport philosophers. Simon employs a question-and-answer, conversational format, one that is peppered with interesting anecdotes. A must read for anyone interested in sport ethics. An important book that plumbs the depths of complex sport ethics questions and relates answers to everyday concerns about values, justice, and fair play. Simon puts to rest, once and for all, any claims that sport is a trivial or otherwise uninteresting phenomenon." --<strong>Scott Kretchmar</strong>, The Pennsylvania State University<p></p><br>"As someone who often has to figure out what's right and wrong in sports, it's comforting to have a bible to offer me guidance. That good book - great book, really - is Bob Simon's <em>The Ethics of Sport: What Everyone Needs to Know</em>. Whether he's addressing the issues involved in the body politic of athletics, or the human body itself, Professor Simon conducts the class that every sports fan, executive and athlete should audit." --<strong>Steve Wulf,</strong> Senior Writer, ESPN <br><p></p><br>"The fact that simon is able to draw some examples from his own experience coaching an NCAA Division III golf team lends the discussion a sense of authenticity that will win Simon credibility with readers.

To accomplish this, the content is organized in a way that combines the most useful features of a functional group approach with one largely based on reaction mechanisms. The authors' philosophy is to emphasize mechanisms and their common aspects as often as possible, and at the same time, use the unifying features of functional groups as the basis for most chapters. The structural aspects of the authors' approach show students what organic chemistry is. Mechanistic aspects of their approach show students how it works. And wherever an opportunity arises, the authors' show students what it does in living systems and the physical world around us.</p></p><p><p><b>T.W.

Rayfield: Pioneer Black Architect of Birmingham, Alabama</h2><p>In the early 1990s, while cleaning out the barn on his property in Bessemer, Alabama, Allen Durough discovered the remnants of the lifework of African American architect Wallace A. Rayfield, including several hundred of Rayfield&#x2019;s drawings, floor plans, business advertisements, family portraits, and graphic art pieces. This book gathers that priceless material legacy into a cohesive whole, reproducing 159 illustrations that document Rayfield&#x2019;s life and work on two continents.&nbsp;Born in Macon, Georgia, in 1873, Rayfield apprenticed as a young man with the noted architectural firm A. B. Mullet and Company in Washington, DC, before attending HowardUniversity, Pratt Polytechnic Institute, and ultimately graduating with a bachelor of architecture degree from ColumbiaUniversity. He returned south to teach at the Tuskegee Institute and then to establish W. A. Rayfield &amp; Co., Architects, in Birmingham, Alabama. From there he designed buildings for construction across the south (many by mail order) and even in Africa. Rayfield specialized in church architecture, and many of his designs were for black congregations within the state, most notably the SixteenthStreetBaptistChurch in Birmingham. But he also designed schools, office buildings, and private homes. After falling into bankruptcy during the Great Depression, he died in obscurity.&nbsp;Durough includes catalog-style descriptive entries and illustrations of Rayfield&#x2019;s designs for six types of structures: residences, churches, schools, commercial buildings, fraternal buildings, and barns. These entries contain location, commissioning data, and brief structural notes, providing a useful resource for architectural historians and preservationists. A listing of the 359 known Rayfield&nbsp;structures detail their locations in 19 states, plan date, building type, and name. Also included is a biographical sketch of Rayfield, an overview of his publications, and a survey of his professional artwork and advertisements.</p><p>&nbsp;<b>Allen R. Durough,</b> a Baptist minister, is a retired insurance executive.&nbsp;&#x201c;Rayfield&#x2019;s Romanesque architectural style, which incorporated thick walls, rounded arches, large towers, and decorative arcading, defied the more popular Gothic trend [at the time] throughout the south. This signature style is evident in his many designs, including the SixteenthStreetBaptistChurch in Birmingham, the site of the infamous bombing on Sept. 15, 1963, and also Tuscaloosa&#x2019;s first African American church, Hunter&#x2019;s Chapel AME Zion, and Ebenezer BaptistChurch in Chicago.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Ashley Boyd, <i>The Tuscaloosa News</i></p><h2>The New Southern Politics</h2><p>Current through the November 2012 elections,&nbsp;The New Southern Politics&nbsp;seamlessly integrates a thematic overview of the distinctive political, social, and economic life of eleven southern states with a detailed state-by-state focus.

When the Nazis took power in 1933, they installed a program of eugenics--the attempted "improvement" of the population through forced sterilization and marriage controls--that consciously drew on the U.S. example. By then, many American states had long had compulsory sterilization laws for "defectives," upheld by the Supreme Court in 1927. Small wonder that the Nazi laws led one eugenics activist in Virginia to complain, "The Germans are beating us at our own game."<br> In <em>The Nazi Connection</em>, Stefan K�hl uncovers the ties between the American eugenics movement and the Nazi program of racial hygiene, showing that many American scientists actively supported Hitler's policies. After introducing us to the recently resurgent problem of scientific racism, K�hl carefully recounts the history of the eugenics movement, both in the United States and internationally, demonstrating how widely the idea of sterilization as a genetic control had become accepted by the early twentieth century. From the first, the American eugenicists led the way with radical ideas. Their influence led to sterilization laws in dozens of states--laws which were studied, and praised, by the German racial hygienists. With the rise of Hitler, the Germans enacted compulsory sterilization laws partly based on the U.S. experience, and American eugenists took pride in their influence on Nazi policies. K�hl recreates astonishing scenes of American eugenicists travelling to Germany to study the new laws, publishing scholarly articles lionizing the Nazi eugenics program, and proudly comparing personal notes from Hitler thanking them for their books. Even after the outbreak of war, he writes, the American eugenicists frowned upon Hitler's totalitarian government, but not his sterilization laws. So deep was the failure to recognize the connection between eugenics and Hitler's genocidal policies, that a prominent liberal Jewish eugenicist who had been forced to flee Germany found it fit to grumble that the Nazis "took over our entire plan of eugenic measures."<br> By 1945, when the murderous nature of the Nazi government was made perfectly clear, the American eugenicists sought to downplay the close connections between themselves and the German program. Some of them, in fact, had sought to distance themselves from Hitler even before the war. But Stefan K�hl's deeply documented book provides a devastating indictment of the influence--and aid--provided by American scientists for the most comprehensive attempt to enforce racial purity in world history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stefan K�hl</strong> is a Professor of Sociology at the University of Bielefeld, Germany.<br>Narrowly focused yet chillingly effective indictment of the American scientists and social theorists who inspired and applauded Nazi racist ideology. Eugenics--part science, part twisted Social Darwinism, according to German sociologist K hl--was first defined in 1883 by Francis Galton as the ``science of improving the stock''--a science that went on to give academic respectability to the earliest expressions of Nazi racism. Insisting that many of the assumptions underlying Nazi thought were ``by no means limited to German scientists,'' the author skillfully dismantles postwar attempts to marginalize the activities of the worldwide eugenics establishment, particularly in the US. With European ties frayed post-WW I, America became the main scientific reference point for German theorists seeking international legitimacy: it unfortunately proved an influential model, not only intellectually but politically. A 1907 Indiana law permitting the sterilization of the mentally handicapped long predated Germany's 1933 Law on Preventing Hereditarily Ill Progeny, and the 1924 American Immigration Restriction Act was later praised by the future F hrer in Mein Kampf. Meanwhile, US sponsors--including the Rockefeller Foundation and Jewish philanthropist James Loeb--helped fund major eugenics institutes in Germany. In turn, many of these sought greater recognition by offering honorary degrees to leading US eugenicists- -two of whom, Leon Whitney and Madison Grant, are glimpsed here proudly comparing appreciative letters from Hitler. A brief reference to a resurgence of scientific racism in today's academia adds an especially pertinent cautionary note. More a monograph than a fully realized history but, still, a well-documented revisionist rebuke to those who would isolate Nazism as a unique phenomenon. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now the third and final volume brings the story of the Union Pacific--the oldest, largest, and most successful railroad of modern times--fully up to date. <br><br>The book follows the trajectory of an icon of the industrial age trying to negotiate its way in a post-railway world, plagued by setbacks such as labor disputes, aging infrastructure, government de-regulation, ill-fated mergers, and more. By 1969 the same company that a century earlier had triumphantly driven the golden spike into Promontory Summit--to immortalize the nation's first transcontinental railway--seemed a dinosaur destined for financial ruin. But as Klein shows, the Union Pacific not only survived but is once more thriving, which proves that railways remain critical to commerce and industry in America, even as passenger train travel has all but disappeared. Drawing on interviews with Union Pacific personnel past and present, Klein takes readers inside the great railroad--into its boardrooms and along its tracks--to show how the company adapted to the rapidly changing world of modern transportation. The book also offers fascinating portraits of the men who have run the railroad. The challenges they faced, and the strategies they developed to meet them, give readers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of one of America's great companies. <br><br>A capstone on a remarkable achievement, <em>Union Pacific: The Reconfiguration</em> will appeal to historians, business scholars, and transportation buffs alike.<br></p><p><br><strong>Maury Klein</strong> is Professor of History Emeritus, University of Rhode Island and the author of many books, including <em>The Power Makers</em>.<br><br>"Mr. Klein has written thoroughly researched and scrupulously objective biographies of the previously much maligned Jay Gould and E.

Fujitani illustrates what visual symbols and rituals reveal about monarchy, nationalism, city planning, discipline, gender, memory, and modernity. Focusing on the Meiji Period (1868-1912), Fujitani brings recent methods of cultural history to a study of modern Japanese nationalism for the first time.</p><p>In 1993, Masako Owada captured the world&#39;s attention when she agreed to marry Crown Prince Naruhito of Japan. She was widely portrayed as a progressive, Westernized woman about to enter one of the last bastions of traditional Japanese sexism. Crown Prince Naruhito&#39;s world was known to be steeped in ancient tradition, and the strictures placed on her were seen as tragic vestiges of the patriarchal past. But in this dramatic departure from accepted assumptions about Japan, T. Fujitani argues that just over a century ago, there was no such thing as an imperial family, imperial family, imperial wedding ceremonies were unheard of, and the image of the emperor as patriarch did not exist. Demonstrating how the trappings of the emperor were imported from nineteenth-century Western courts, he concludes that the Japanese monarchy as we know it is actually an invention of modern times. Fujitani focuses on public ceremonials and the construction of ritual spaces in the Meiji Period (1868-1912). His work is based on extensive research in Japanese archives and libraries, including the archives of the Imperial Household Agency. To explore the modern transformations of what is often portrayed as the longest continuously reigning monarchy in the world, he focuses on the monarchy&#39;s location within a modern regime of power, city planning, the media, and the gendering of politics. Throughout, he presents rare photographs and woodblock prints to trace the image of the emperor from a mysterious figure secluded inside a palanquin to a grand public personage riding in an open carriage in Western military regalia.<b>T.

Written in a vivid and accessible style, <em>A History of Europe in the Twentieth Century</em> examines the continent's descent into the turmoil of two world wars, the tense cold war standoff between the victors, and finally the beginning of a more tranquil and egalitarian age. Rather than viewing Europe's history from an outdated perspective colored by cold war ideology, Eric Dorn Brose discusses these topics from a contemporary point of view, looking backward at the total impact of major events on the European world. <br> <em>A History of Europe in the Twentieth Century</em> is organized chronologically around five main themes: <br>* war and the quest for alternatives <br>* ethnic and racial belligerency and the effort to create harmony <br>* authoritarianism and the struggle for democracy <br>* technological revolutions and systems <br>* elite and popular culture <br>This thematic approach allows students to focus on separate specific aspects of the history of this troubled century, while striving for a composite view. Brose also dedicates special subsections of the text to extensive discussions of the peace movement, gender relations, the Holocaust, cultural developments, the rise of the EU, and today's terrorist threats. Each chapter begins with a vignette related to chapter themes and subject matter. There is also a historiographical component to <em>A History of Europe in the Twentieth Century</em>, making it ideal for upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses in twentieth-century Europe.<br></p><p>Eric Dorn Brose is at Drexel University.</p><h2>Lose the Resume, Land the Job</h2><p><p>"'Lose the R�sum�' breaks down every aspect of job hunting, explaining what matters and what doesn&#x2019;t."&nbsp;&#x2013; <i>The New York Times </i>Book Review<br><br><b>Lose the resume and land that coveted job </b></p> <p>Gone are the days of polishing up your resume and sending it out at random.

It also proposes evaluating school systems according to their achievement of equality and freedom.<br> <br> Education in the 21st century is widely viewed as a necessary condition for the promotion of human welfare, and thus identified as a basic human right. Educational rights are included in many national constitutions written since the global spread of human rights ideas after World War II. But as a global idea, the meaning of educational rights varies between civilizations. In this book, which builds on the concept of the universal right to education set forth in Spring's <i>The Universal Right to Education: Justification, Definition, and Guidelines, </i> his intercivilizational analysis of educational rights focuses on four of the world's major civilizations: Confucian, Islamic, Western, and Hindu.<br> <br> Spring begins by considering educational rights as part of the global flow of ideas and the global culture of schooling. He also considers the tension this generates within different civilizational traditions. Next, he proceeds to:<br> *examine the meaning of educational rights in the Confucian tradition, in the recent history of China, and in the Chinese Constitution;<br> *look at educational rights in the context of Islamic civilization and as presented in the constitutions of Islamic countries, including an analysis of the sharp contrast between the religious orientation of Islamic educational rights and those of China and the West;<br> *explore the problems created by the Western natural rights tradition and the eventual acceptance of educational rights as represented in European constitutions, with a focus on the development and prominence given in the West to the relationship between schooling and equality of opportunity; and,<br> *investigate the effect of global culture on India and the blend of Western and Hindu ideas in the Indian constitution, highlighting the obstacles to fulfillment of educational rights created by centuries of discrimination against women and lower castes.<br> <br> In his conclusion, Spring presents an educational rights statement based on his intercivilizational analysis and his examination of national constitutions. This statement is intended to serve as a model for the inclusion of educational rights in national constitutions.<br></p><p>Joel Spring is currently a professor at Queens College of the City University of New York.

Man?s activities have probably changed the earth?s electromagnetic background to a greater degree than they have changed any other natural physical attribute of the earth. The evidence now indicates that the present abnormal electromagnetic environment constitutes a significant health risk. There are also positive aspects of the relationship between electromagnetism and life. Clinical uses of electromagnetic energy are increasing and promise to expand into important areas in the near future. This book synthesizes the various aspects of the role of electricity in biology.</p></p><p>Andrew Marino is a biophysicist and attorney with a special interest in the scientific and societal implications of the ubiquitous presence of electromagnetic energy in the environmental and workplace environments. He has co-authored several hundred publications in the area over the last forty years. He is married and the father of four children.Becker and Marino present a comprehensive review of the influence of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) on living systems. beginning with an overview of the scientific and political history of bioelectrical phenomena, they go on to discuss what is known about intrinsic and natural EMFs, and the effects of man-made EMFs on the nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, hematological, immune and reproductive systems. <p>The authors, well known for their work on regeneration, develop the hypothesis that intrinsic EMFs control biological functions, while natural EMFs convey information to living organisms. Article fields, meanwhile, act as stressors -- stimuli that elicit a common physiological, adaptive response. In this well-referenced book, Becker and Marino contend that "the present abnormal electromagnetic environment can constitute a health risk." --Microwave News, June, 1982<br><br>This book synthesizes the various aspects of the role of electricity in biology and emphasizes their underlying unity. It is organized in four parts. The first two parts deal with historical factors and the bio-regulatory role of electromagnetic energy. The other two parts deal with bioeffects of artificial electromagnetic energy. The most apparent effects of electricity viz, heat and shock are not included in this monograph. Nonetheless the monograph is addressed to a broad range of readers who would be stimulated to do further evaluation and research. --Medical Book News - A Guide to New Books, May, 1983<br><br>This book represents the authors' provocative insights from decades of research into bioelectric effects. It begins with a historical but lively account of past research seeking to discover the vital animal or electrical forces distinguishing the living from the nonliving. Galvani's erroneous conclusions regarding animal electricity in 1786 were opportunistically diverted by Volta and others from the biologic realm into the technology of generating electricity. The discovery of voltaic electricity led to the battery-operated telegraph, the arc light, and, ultimately, to the major dominance of electricity in today's society. The difficult questions pertaining to electricity's role in complex living forms remained unanswered. Biochemical explanations of biologic control systems dominated. Any suggestion of electrical control systems within the body was promptly equated with "vital force" research and dismissed as unscientific. </p><p>Current concepts of electrobiologic controls owe more to developments in solid state physics than to biologic research. Body functions for which the authors describe electromagnetic influences include neuronal activity, growth, healing, and even possibly regeneration of parts. The beneficial aspects of these findings have already been exploited clinically to treat healing problems in the skeletal system. The feasibility of biasing DC flow in the CNS to induce anesthesia or to control pain ahs also been demonstrated. </p><p>Unfortunately, there are also potentially detrimental effects to consider, particularly from exposure to intense electromagnetic fields produced in today's society. The authors define such exposure as a general biologic stressor. Its significance is difficult to contest or to support, since any such stress would be an unsensed one. This question cries for better epidemiologic measurements. Unfortunately, the authors opt mainly for risk evaluations and regulations based on animal testing. This should distress most of us readers who already sense an overenthusiastic application of animal toxicology to control human affairs. It should not, however, detract seriously from the overall impact of this important book for scientists, engineers, physicians, students, and the general public. This book does indeed provide "a guide to be used [cautiously] at the beginning of an interesting journey." --Journal of the American Medical Association, August 6, 1982<br><br>Part Four describes environmental electromagnetic energy, consisting mainly of powerline frequencies and radio and television signals. Results of epidemiological studies are given for a variety of exposure levels and frequencies. The last chapter is a brief description of therapeutic application of electromagnetic energy in osteogenesis and acupuncture. </p><p>Most topics in this book are introduced with brief descriptions of basic concepts. Considering the amount of material covered in the book, this brevity, which also is seen in some of the main subject matter, keeps the length of the book reasonable. However, this brevity also results in the book being best understood by a reader with a background in physiology or biophysics. The book is written in a concise, organized manner that makes for uncluttered reading (somewhat marred by a number of typographical errors). At least in part, the conciseness is because there are fewer literature references than what a comprehensive treatise would have required; the reader should weigh the presented material accordingly. It also should be noted that the authors reference Soviet literature extensively and sometimes exclusively. In some cases, this is understandable since some of the Soviet studies are unique; in other cases, reference to more works would make a more balanced presentation. The serious researcher also should consult recent, related books and the current scientific literature. </p><p>Although the controversy over the general topic of this book is acknowledged in the preface, the reader who doesn't read the preface would not realize a controversy existed since little of the other side is given in the rest of the book. However, by bringing together the evidence for the "subthermal" effects of electromagnetic energy on biological systems, Becker and Marino have succeeded in their goal to provide a guide to the subject. The material must serve as an introduction since the overall meaning of the data presented is not brought into focus; this may be because it cannot be focused now. The evidence presented by the authors shows little in common among biological effects except that they seem to occur. Many readers will disagree with the authors' concepts and conclusions about interactions of the electromagnetic environment with biological systems. However, these disagreements may form the basis for their own resolution through future, well-designed experiments using the results of studies reviewed in this book. --IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology, December, 1982</p></p><h2>The Experience of Philosophy</h2><p>This exceptional anthology immerses students in such powerful ideas that they will find themselves not just reading about, but actually participating in, the kind of philosophical thinking that can change the way they look at their lives and the world around them. Now in a new edition, <em>The</em> <em>Experience of Philosophy</em> features eighty five readings that challenge students' thinking about God, freedom, reality, nothingness, death, and their own identities. Provocative and accessible, these selections have been carefully chosen for their ability to draw students out of an ordinary frame of reference into exciting new territory. Although the editors include many classic sources from philosophers such as Plato, Descartes, Locke, and Kant, the emphasis is on contemporary writings. Articles by Derek Parfit, Bertrand Russell, and others help students see philosophy's links to literature, the natural sciences, and the physical and social sciences. The sixth edition features twelve new essays by Augustine, Alvin Plantinga and Daniel Kolak, Georges Rey, Fred Dretske, David Reisman, Paul Teller, Clea F. Rees, Padmasiri de Silva, Daniel Kolak, Karl Marx, Anand Chandavarkar, and Vincent Hendricks as well as more text boxes offering excerpts from other relevant works.<br> <em>The Experience of Philosophy</em>, Sixth Edition, integrates helpful pedagogical aids including section introductions, a brief introduction to each selection, biographical information on each author, and questions before and after each reading to reinforce main ideas and promote thinking. Further readings after each selection direct students to additional material on related issues. Ideal for introductory philosophy courses, <em>The Experience of Philosophy</em>, Sixth Edition, encourages students to "do" philosophy, rather than just read about its history.<br></p><p>Daniel Kolak is at William Paterson University of New Jersey.

Milner focus especially on the ambivalence of this expression: the fact that it is too unwieldy, too variable across cases, to be essentialized as old or new, vernacular or institutional, generative or destructive. Online expression is, instead, all of the above. This ambivalence, the authors argue, hinges on available digital tools. That said, there is nothing unexpected or surprising about even the strangest online behavior. Ours is a brave new world, and there is nothing new under the sun &#x2013; a point necessary to understanding not just that online spaces are rife with oddity, mischief, and antagonism, but why these behaviors matter.</p> <p><i>The Ambivalent Internet</i> is essential reading for students and scholars of digital media and related fields across the humanities, as well as anyone interested in mediated culture and expression.</p></p><p><b>Ryan M.

Yet the way she has been mythologised has meant her work is often misunderstood. This introduction delves behind the myth to present a poet who was deeply engaged with the issues of her day. In a lucid and elegant style, the book places her life and work in the historical context of the Civil War, the suffrage movement, and the rapid industrialisation of the United States. Wendy Martin explores the ways in which Dickinson&#39;s personal struggles with romantic love, religious faith, friendship and community shape her poetry. The complex publication history of her works, as well as their reception, is teased out, and a guide to further reading is included. Dickinson emerges not only as one of America&#39;s finest poets, but also as a fiercely independent intellect and an original talent writing poetry far ahead of her time.</p><p>This introduction delves behind the myth of the reclusive Emily Dickinson to present a poet who was deeply engaged with the issues of her day.

As an indirect but vital factor in the social work process, it is surprising that supervision has not received as much attention as other components of social work practice, such as social work research or administration. A book on social work supervision is desperately needed to bridge the gap between the demands of the field and the absence of literature. Social Work Supervision: Contexts and Concepts aims to provide readers with basic knowledge of theories, research, and practice of supervision. The book will address the needs of social work supervisors, frontline practitioners, students, and educators.The book is ideally suited as a text for graduate courses on social work supervision, as it contains a comprehensive literature review of the historical development, theories and models, and empirical research studies of the subject. Equally important, this is a book from practice experience in supervision that enhances the competence of supervisory practice. It will help social workers, supervisors, and administrators to realize and revitalize their &#x201c;mission&#x201d; in social work, that is, to benefit clients.</p><p><p>Ming-sum Tsui is Senior Lecturer in Social Work, Department of Applied Social Sciences, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University where he teaches social work supervision and human service management.

He has worked as a senior engineer with the California Department of Transportation and as a Principal for Structural Safety with the California Division of the State Architect. Dr. Williams has published several textbooks and papers on structural engineering design, structural analysis, seismic design, and reinforced and prestressed concrete design.PART 1: HOW TO USE THIS BOOK<br><br> This <i>Structural Engineering Reference Manual</i> is intended to help you prepare for the 16-hour Structural Engineering (SE) exam administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES). The NCEES SE exam will test your knowledge of structural principles by presenting problems that cover the design of an entire structure or portion of a structure. The exam is given in four modules&#x2014;two concerning vertical forces and two concerning lateral forces. The eight chapters of this book are organized around the eight areas in which these forces are applied.<br><br> These eight areas include<br><br> � reinforced concrete design<br> � foundations and retaining structures<br> � prestressed concrete design<br> � structural steel design<br> � timber design<br> � reinforced masonry design<br> � lateral forces (wind and seismic)<br> � bridge design<br><br> Each chapter presents structural design principles thatbuild on the ones before, so you should read the chapters in the order in which they are presented. The examples in each chapter should also be read in sequence. Taken together in this way, they constitute the solution to a complete design problem similar to that on the exam.<br><br> Your solutions to the NCEES SE exam problems must be based on the NCEES-adopted codes and design standards. Therefore, you should carefully review the appropriate sections of the exam-adopted design standards and codes that are presented, analyzed, and explained in each chapter of this book. The examples in this book also focus on one specific code principle and offer a clear interpretation of that principle.<br><br> Table 1 lists the NCEES SE design standards that code-based problems on the exam will reference. You will not receive credit for solutions based on other editions or standards. All problems are in customary U.S. (English) units, and you will not receive credit for solutions using SI units.<br><br> Abbreviations are used throughout this book to refer to the design standards and codes referenced by the NCEES SE exam. This book's &#x201c;Codes and References section lists these abbreviations in brackets after their appropriate design standard or code. This book also cites other publications that discuss pertinent structural design procedures, which may also be found in the &#x201c;Codes&#x201d; section. Text references to any other publications are numbered as endnotes in each chapter, and the publications are cited in the &#x201c;References&#x201d; section that precedes each chapter&#x2019;s practice problems. These references are provided for your additional review.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Foundation of Merit: Public Service in American Democracy (Interpreting American Politics)</h2><p>The first systematic examination of the federal civil service in nearly forty years, The Foundation of Merit analyzes the historical development of the civil service in the context of the political and democratic environment that is central to its effectiveness and legitimacy. Patricia Ingraham describes theincremental and disjointed growth of the federal civil service and explains how, and why, it came to be a system with control in the wrong places, with discretion in the wrong places, and why-in its current form-it has little hope of meeting the enormous challenges of the next century.

Moreover, groundbreaking research on genes, and especially key families of genes such as the Homeobox genes which control the development of body plans, has led to radical changes in the classification of animals. In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, Peter Holland presents a cutting-edge tour of the animal kingdom, providing an authoritative summary of the modern view of animal life, its origins, and the new classification resulting from DNA studies. Beginning with the definition of animals (not obvious in biological terms), Holland takes the reader through the revolutionary new high-level groupings of animals (phyla) based on evolutionary relationships and ancestry. Ranging from corals and sponges to nematodes, sea squirts, and vertebrates, and illuminating many key topics in zoology, this fascinating, brief overview will be of great value to all students of the life sciences as well as providing a concise summary for the interested lay reader.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter Holland</strong> is Linacre Professor of Zoology and Fellow of Merton College, Department of Zoology, University of Oxford.<br></p><h2>Heidegger on Ontotheology: Technology and the Politics of Education</h2><p>Heidegger is now widely recognized as one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century, yet much of his later philosophy remains shrouded in confusion and controversy.

It will be required reading for those seeking to understand the relationship between Heidegger&#39;s philosophy and National Socialism as well as the continuing relevance of his work.</p><p>"The impressive achievement of this book is the way Thomson, by focusing on Heidegger's historicist understanding of metaphysics, manages to make the thought of 'the later Heidegger,' so often charged with obscurity and mysticism, accessible and philosophically interesting." &nbsp;-Ingvild Torsen,&nbsp;<i>Review of Metaphysics.</i></p><h2>Financial Accounting, Student Value Edition Plus MyLab Accounting with Pearson eText -- Access Card Package</h2><p><p> <b>NOTE:</b>&nbsp;This edition features the same content as the traditional text in a convenient, three-hole-punched, loose-leaf version.

Hailed as the most outstanding book in the biomedical sciences when it was originally published in 1990, <em>Manic-Depressive Illness</em> was the first to survey this massive body of evidence comprehensively and to assess its meaning for both clinician and scientist. It also vividly portrayed the experience of manic-depressive illness from the perspective of patients, their doctors, and researchers. Encompassing an understanding about the illness as Kraeplin conceived of it- about its cyclical course and about the essential unity of its bipolar and recurrent unipolar forms- the book has become <em>the</em> definitive work on the topic, revered by both specialists and nonspecialists alike. <br> <br> Now, in this magnificent second edition, Drs. Frederick Goodwin and Kay Redfield Jamison bring their unique contribution to mental health science into the 21st century. In collaboration with a team of other leading scientists, a collaboration designed to preserve the unified voice of the two authors, they exhaustively review the biological and genetic literature that has dominated the field in recent years and incorporate cutting-edge research conducted since publication of the first edition. They also update their surveys of psychological and epidemiological evidence, as well as that pertaining to diagnostic issues, course, and outcome, and they offer practical guidelines for differential diagnosis and clinical management. The medical treatment of manic and depressive episodes is described, strategies for preventing future episodes are given in detail, and psychotherapeutic issues common in this illness are considered. Special emphasis is given to fostering compliance with medication regimens and treating patients who abuse drugs and alcohol or who pose a risk of suicide. This book, unique in the way that it retains the distinct perspective of its authors while assuring the maximum in-depth coverage of a vastly expanded base of scientific knowledge, will be a valuable and necessary addition to the libraries of psychiatrists and other physicians, psychologists, clinical social workers, neuroscientists, pharmacologists, and the patients and families who live with manic-depressive illness.<br></p><p>Frederick K. Goodwin is Director of the Center on Neuroscience, Behavior and Society, George Washington University. Kay Redfield Jamison is a Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University.<br>"<em>Manic-Depressive Illness</em> stands above other selections in the field because of its organization and the clarity of presentation, in addition to the way it reveals the most cutting-edge thinking in the field.

In 2002, more than 630,000 individuals left federal and state prisons. Thirty years ago, only 150,000 did. In the intense political debate over America's punishment policies, the impact of these returning prisoners on families and communities has been largely overlooked. In But They All Come Back, Jeremy Travis continues his pioneering work on the new realities of punishment in America vis-a-vis public safety, families and children, work, housing, public health, civic identity, and community capacity. Travis proposes organizing the criminal justice system around five principles of reentry to encourage change and spur innovation.</p><p>Jeremy Travis became the fourth president of John Jay College of Criminal Justice on August 16, 2004. Prior to his appointment, Mr. Travis served four years as a senior fellow affiliated with the Justice Policy Center at the Urban Institute, where he launched a national research program on prisoner reentry into society and initiated research agendas on crime in a community context, sentencing, and international crime. While at the Urban Institute, Mr. Travis cochaired the Reentry Roundtable, a group of nationally prominent researchers and policymakers devoted to exploring the dimensions of prisoner reentry. From 1994 to 2000, Mr. Travis was the director of the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). A key figure in the development of new approaches to prisoner reentry, he pioneered the concept of the reentry court, designed the Department of Justice&#39;s reentry partnership initiative, and created the federal reentry program in President Clinton&#39;s FY 2000 budget. Before! his tenure at NIJ, Mr. Travis was deputy commissioner of legal matters at the New York City Police Department, chief counsel to the House of Representatives Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, and special advisor to the mayor of New York City. Mr. Travis has received numerous awards for his contributions to the field of criminal justice, including the American Society of Criminology&#39;s August Vollmer Award, the Gerhard O. W. Muller Award from the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences, and the Margaret Mead Award from the International Community Corrections Association. He has taught courses on criminal justice, public policy, history, and law at Yale College, New York University&#39;s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, New York Law School, and George Washington Universit"...[A] must-read for anyone interested in prisoner reentry and social justice in America." -- <i>Joan Petersilia, Ph.D., Professor of Criminology, University of California, Irvine, and author of <i>When Prisoners Come Home</i></i><br><br>"...[C]ombines a compelling theoretical perspective with a detailed practical guide to fashioning an effective public policy strategy..." -- <i>Marc Mauer, Assistant Director, The Sentencing Project, and author of <i>Race to Incarcerate</i></i><br><br>"Jeremy Travis masterfully analyzes the challenges that arise from what he so aptly terms &#x2018;the iron law of corrections&#x2019;" -- <i>Ashbel T.

In a follow up to the book, Doing Race in Social Studies (2015), this new volume addresses practical considerations of teaching about race within the context of history, geography, government, economics, and the behavioral sciences. Race Lessons: Using Inquiry to Teach About Race in Social Studies addresses the space between the theoretical and the practical and provides teachers and teacher educators with concrete lesson ideas for how to engage learners with social studies content and race. Oftentimes, social studies teachers do not teach about race because of several factors: teacher fear, personal notions of colorblindness, and attachment to multicultural narratives that stress assimilation. This volume will begin to help teachers and teacher educators start the conversation around realistic and practical race pedagogy. The chapters included in this volume are written by prominent social studies scholars and classroom teachers. This work is unique in that it represents an attempt to use Critical Race Theory and inquiry pedagogy (Inquiry Design Model) to teach about race in the social science disciplines.</p><p>Prentice T.

And they are continually stretching to enhance their ministries. Hospital administrators and other professionals on the care teams, however, often need help to grasp those same values in outcome oriented, observable, documentable, changes-for-the-better terms. The Discipline for Pastoral Care Giving: Foundations for Outcome Oriented Chaplaincy offers a powerful new paradigm for enhancing supportive, effective spiritual care for patients and families as well as communicating substantive outcomes to leaders and clinicians alike. This is all the more important in these times when every possible resource must be well used for the good of our patients and their families.<br><br>By evaluating the pastoral care you offer, you can become more aware of the discrete skills you exercise in the assessment, planning, intervention, and reflection process. Such evaluation efforts highlight the discrete differences excellent spiritual care makes. This can help you track contributions you are making in terms of the patient's healing and well-being. Having a sound, replicable way to make the process more conscious also helps you communicate your assessment, strategies, and contributions more clearly to other care team members. Furthermore, consistently using The Discipline over time will enable you to discover patterns of spiritual dynamics in how people live with different health care challenges in their lives. These patterns translate into valuable insights as your care for others.<br><br>The process discussed in The Discipline for Pastoral Care Giving calls on the chaplain to: <ul><li> identify the patient's spiritual needs, hopes, and resources </li><li> construct a patient profile through identifying the individual's sense of the holy, sense of meaning, sense of hope, and sense of community </li><li> design the desired outcome(s) you hope your care will contribute--for example, a person who has suffered a spinal cord injury integrates the effects of their injury in their sense of identity and meaning, a person living with cystic fibrosis healthfully grieves the loss of others in the CF community, a patient 'disabled&#x2019;by the absence of her support community regains use of her personal resources for coping and self-care </li><li> develop and share a plan for the patient's spiritual care </li><li> choose interventions (which may range from facilitating a life review, to compassionate confrontation, to reading Scripture, to active listening, to arranging a family care conference) </li><li> measure outcomes, identifying and communicating the difference your care has made in terms of the patient's healing and well-being<br><br>The Discipline for Pastoral Care Giving offers case studies, personal experiences, helpful figures and charts, and suggestions for dealing with patients experiencing unique, complex health care challenges, including adults living with cystic fibrosis and violent victims of violence. The wise advice and practical suggestions in this book will help you recognize and document the solid value of your hospital ministry.</li></ul></p><p></p><h2>An Introduction to American Policing</h2><p>An Introduction to American Policing continues to engage students with a balanced yet critical investigation of police history and theory.

There are knowledgeable discussions of the Visigoth monarchy, Moorish Spain, the establishment of an empire, and the eighteenth-century Enlightenment. Carr examines not only the political and economic development of Spain, but also the extraordinary artistic and literary achievements of the Spanish people. He charts the rise and fall of liberalism in the nineteenth century, and the subsequent period of political instability culminating in the Civil War and authoritarian rule. The book concludes with a look at modern Spain as a fully integrated and enthusiastic member of the European community.<br><br>Attractively illustrated throughout, <em>Spain: A History</em> is the best historical account of Spain currently available for general readers.<br></p><p>Spain, influential historians once maintained, was an "exceptional" country--meaning that, in many key respects, it lay outside the course of European history. Unlike any other nation of Western Europe, Spain was for centuries the province of Islamic rulers, and the crowned heads of other parts of the continent scorned it as an "oriental," necessarily backward nation--when in many ways it was considerably more advanced than its neighbors.<p> The exceptionalist view of Spanish history was misguided and damaging, writes the eminent historian Raymond Carr, but it was one that many Spanish people accepted: to them, it helped explain why Spain, once so mighty and rich an empire, should have fallen behind while the rest of Europe grew stronger and wealthier, and why a retrograde ruler like Franco could have remained in power when democracy flourished elsewhere.</p><p> Carr and his colleagues, including several Spanish scholars, seek to restore Spain to the mainstream of European history in this highly useful survey. Taking in a view that extends deep into prehistory and forward to the recent presidential elections, the contributors emphasize the diversity of Spain's many peoples, whose union under the kings and queens of Castile and Aragon would bring so much of the world under Spanish dominion, and the difficulty of maintaining that political union in the recent climate of ethnic and regional rivalry. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br><strong>Sir Raymond Carr</strong> is the former Warden of St. Antony's College, Oxford University.

Any educator's library should include this."&#x2015;<b>California Book Watch</b><br><br>Zull begins his journey with sensory-motor learning, and how that leads to discovery, and discovery to emotion. He then describes how deeper learning develops, how symbolic systems such as language and numbers emerge as tools for thought, how memory builds a knowledge base, and how memory is then used to create ideas and solve problems. Along the way he prompts us to think of new ways to shape educational experiences from early in life through adulthood, informed by the insight that metacognition lies at the root of all learning.

Data vendors such as Reuters transmit more than 275,000 prices per day for foreign exchange spot rates alone. Thus, high-frequency data can be a fundamental object of study, as traders make decisions by observing high-frequency or tick-by-tick data. Yet most studies published in financial literature deal with low frequency, regularly spaced data. For a variety of reasons, high-frequency data are becoming a way for understanding market microstructure. This book discusses the best mathematical models and tools for dealing with such vast amounts of data.<br>This book provides a framework for the analysis, modeling, and inference of high frequency financial time series. With particular emphasis on foreign exchange markets, as well as currency, interest rate, and bond futures markets, this unified view of high frequency time series methods investigates the price formation process and concludes by reviewing techniques for constructing systematic trading models for financial assets.</p><p>"The authors have shaped the field of high-frequency data in finance; the text provides an excellent summary of their pioneering work."<br>--Paul Embrechts, Professor of Mathematics, ETH Zurich<br>"<b>An Introduction to High-Frequency Finance</b> by the research team from Olsen &amp; Associates is an amazing presentation of their work over the last decade and a half examining high-frequency, primarily currency, data.

It Includes Print Book Only<br><br>READING KEYS - the first in a three-book reading series by Laraine Flemming - offers a comprehensive introduction to reading skills and strategies, from using context clues to identifying purpose and bias. Clear, accessible explanations present reading concepts without oversimplifying the process of reading comprehension. To ensure students' understanding, reading "keys" or summaries follow the explanations, breaking them down into manageable chunks. Throughout each chapter, a variety of steadily more difficult exercises assess students' understanding of the material and promote improved comprehension and critical-thinking skills. This incremental approach to instruction and assessment makes it easier for beginning readers to absorb and master new information. The Fourth Edition includes new chapters on analyzing arguments and sentence relationships. In addition, there is a greater emphasis on recognizing and understanding verbal clues to meaning, new discussions on how the brain learns and remembers new information, and several new engaging readings.</p><p>After receiving her B.S. at Southern Connecticut State University, where she was certified as a teacher of secondary reading, Laraine Flemming went on to earn an M.A. in English literature at Boston College and a Ph.D. in American literature at the State University of New York in Buffalo.

Feminists, they claim, reduce art to politics and are hostile to any form of aesthetic pleasure. <i>Literature after Feminism</i> is the first work to comprehensively rebut such caricatures, while also offering a clear-eyed assessment of the relative merits of various feminist approaches to literature.<br><br>Spelling out her main arguments clearly and succinctly, Rita Felski explains how feminism has changed the ways people read and think about literature. She organizes her book around four key questions: Do women and men read differently? How have feminist critics imagined the female author? What does plot have to do with gender? And what do feminists have to say about the relationship between literary and political value?

Drawing on interviews with 115 families, the authors look at how parents plan to use this annual cash windfall to build up savings, go back to school, and send their kids to college. However, these dreams of upward mobility are often dashed by the difficulty of trying to get by on meager wages.

They survey the territory of fundamental physics, machine learning, philosophy of human identity, evolutionary biology, miracles, arguments from design, naturalism, the history of ideas, and more. The natural world can be appreciated not only for itself, but also as an eloquent gesture, a narrative and a pointer beyond itself. Our human journey is not to a theorem or a treatise, but to a meeting which encompasses all our capacities. In this meeting, science is the way to find out about the structure of the physical world of which we are a part, not a means to reduce ourselves and our fellow human beings to mere objects of scrutiny, and still less to attempt the utterly futile exercise of trying to do that to God. We have intellectual permission to be open to the notion that God can be trusted and known. The material world encourages an open-hearted reaching out to something more, with a freedom to seek and to be received by what lies beyond the scope of purely impersonal descriptions and attitudes.<br></p><p><br>Andrew Briggs, <em>Professor of Nanomaterials, University of Oxford, UK</em>,Hans Halvorson, <em>Stuart Professor of Philosophy, Princeton University, USA</em>,Andrew Steane, <em>University Lecturer and Fellow, Exeter College, University of Oxford, UK</em><br><br>Andrew Briggs was elected in 2002 as the first holder of the newly created Chair in Nanomaterials at the University of Oxford.

In certain societies work may be a means by which individuals define themselves and/or maintain their quality of life. However, as a whole, work is the essential means by which we all attain our basic needs such as food and water. In our modern society, persons with disability face a society in which jobs and education are not as easily accessible or attainable.

Much of the serious work on her life and historical importance has never been translated from German, and almost all has concentrated on the years of her struggle with Stephen for the English crown. This book examines her career as a whole, including the years as consort of the Emperor Henry V and as regent in Normandy for her son Henry II. It illustrates the problems of female succession in the early twelfth century, and gives a balanced assessment of Matilda&#39;s character and achievements in the context of her own times.</p><p>Granddaughter of William the Conqueror and of King Malcolm of the Scots, and daughter of Henry I, Matilda fought for the throne of England, arguably hers by right, for nine years, and was denied it largely because she was a woman. Contemporary chroniclers said of her that she was &#34;always superior to feminine softness and with a mind steeled and unbroken in adversity&#34;. Most of the serious work on her extraordinary, action-packed life and historical importance lies in untranslated German studies of the last century. In this book Marjorie Chibnall examines her career as a whole, as King Henry&#39;s daughter, as the wife and consort of Emperor Henry V, as Countess of Anjou after the emperor&#39;s death, and as regent for her son, Henry II. An outstanding biography, pieced together from archival sources all over Europe, it is of value and interest both to scholars and the general reader.<b>Marjorie Chibnall</b> is Emeritus Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge, and has also lectured in the universities of Southampton and Aberdeen.

It carefully considers accounts of causation, freedom and determinism, laws of nature, personal identity, mental states, time, material objects, and properties, while inviting students to reflect on metaphysical problems. The philosophical questions discussed include: What makes it the case that one event causes another event? What are material objects? Given that material objects exist, do such things as properties exist? What makes it the case that a person may exist at two different times? An Introduction to Metaphysics makes these tough questions tractable by presenting the features and flaws of current attempts to answer them. Intended primarily for students taking a first class in metaphysics, this lucid and well-written text would also provide an excellent introduction for anyone interested in knowing more about this important area of philosophy.</p><p>What makes it the case that one event causes another event?

This involves going through spatial biochemical, electrophysiological, and organismic dynamical systems and patterns that were discovered by pursuing the theme of phase singularities introduced in the original book. In particular the work on excitability in cell membranes will be thoroughly updated as will the references throughout the book.</p><p><p>From the reviews:</p> <p>"This book is a wonderful exposition about his life&#x2019;s work and is presented with such clarity that the reader gains an insight into details of his manner of thinking...the reader is taken on a quest to solve biological mysteries and travels from the intricate beginnings of formulating the questions, through the apices and troughs of analyzing, and on to the discovery of the holy grail, that which yields biological predictions and answers. One leaves with a sense of understanding that hopefully can be applied to one&#x2019;s own work...this book could easily serve a dual purpose. First, through the introduction of basic mathematical concepts such as topology combined with modeling, the book serves as an introduction helping the non-applied reader to see the beauty of mathematical modeling. Second, because Winfree explains the modeling process very thoroughly, instead of just presenting equations, the book can serve as a medium for the medical professional to acquire an understanding of the modeling process. A wonderful accomplishment...I am proud to have this book on my shelf and consider it...a seminal text in mathematical modeling. This is a text that every first year graduate student should look at in some detail." <em>(Mathematical Reviews)</em></p> <p>"The new edition of The Geometry of Biological Time is a fascinating update of the delightful original. This new edition contains thoughtful commentary on new developments in the field, adding a historical and sociological dimension to the original book's elegant and unifying treatment of biological problems involving processes that repeat themselves regularly, i.e. involve 'rhythmic return through a cycle of change.' The book is an enjoyable page-turner, even for those readers with only a passing interest in biology, and demonstrates well the synergistic effect between biology and mathematics. ...<br>The term 'page-turner' may seem unusual in mathematics; however, it is appropriate here. Not only is the reader continually tantalized by the figures appearing on the ensuing pages, but the new commentary lends a mystery-novel feeling to the book. This second edition was created by inserting new text boxes into the original, mostly intact, edition. This style leads to a fascinating historical picture. For example, the text, '(...In the latter cases the periodicity approximation gets worse closer to the pivot. I wish here to sweep such matters under the rug (in 1978))' is followed by a new text box that begins, 'The bulge under the rug grew and grew...', continuing with a description of developments over the last two decades. The plot continues even now, with descriptions of the last twenty years often followed in the book by descriptions of current puzzles. In summary, the original book is good and the second edition is even better; the historical commentary is fascinating, and there are also a few reorganized and new chapters presenting additonal biological examples." <em>(MAA Online)</em></p></p><h2>Remembering Simplified Hanzi 1: How Not to Forget the Meaning and Writing of Chinese Characters</h2><p><p>At long last the approach that has helped thousands of learners memorize Japanese kanji has been adapted to help students with Chinese characters. Book 1 of <i>Remembering Simplified Hanzi</i> covers the writing and meaning of the 1,000 most commonly used characters in the simplified Chinese writing system, plus another 500 that are best learned at an early stage. (Book 2 adds another 1,500 characters for a total of 3,000.)<br><br>Of critical importance to the approach found in these pages is the systematic arranging of characters in an order best suited to memorization. In the Chinese writing system, strokes and simple components are nested within relatively simple characters, which can, in turn, serve as parts of more complicated characters and so on. Taking advantage of this allows a logical ordering, making it possible for students to approach most new characters with prior knowledge that can greatly facilitate the learning process.<br><br>Guidance and detailed instructions are provided along the way. Students are taught to employ "imaginative memory" to associate each character&#x2019;s component parts, or "primitive elements," with one another and with a key word that has been carefully selected to represent an important meaning of the character. This is accomplished through the creation of a "story" that engagingly ties the primitive elements and key word together. In this way, the collections of dots, strokes, and components that make up the characters are associated in memorable fashion, dramatically shortening the time required for learning and helping to prevent characters from slipping out of memory.</p></p><p><b>James W.

Exploring ideas of unity and diversity as they have evolved since the Civil War, he illuminates the historical background to our ongoing search for social connectedness and sources of authority in a society increasingly dominated by the premises of individualism. McClay borrows D. H. Lawrence's term 'masterless men'--extending its meaning to women as well--and argues that it is expressive of both the promise and the peril inherent in the modern American social order. <br><br>Drawing upon a wide range of disciplines--including literature, sociology, political science, philosophy, psychology, and feminist theory--McClay identifies a competition between visions of dispersion on the one hand and coalescence on the other as modes of social organization. In addition, he employs intellectual biography to illuminate the intersection of these ideas with the personal experiences of the thinkers articulating them and shows how these shifting visions are manifestations of a more general ambivalence about the process of national integration and centralization that has characterized modern American economic, political, and cultural life.<br><br></p><p>"A fascinating intellectual history."-- <i>America</i> <br>&#39;Liberty is all every well, but men cannot live without masters.

The first regards the other as an entirely different being from oneself, but one which is still recognizable. The second understands and recognizes this other by its function as a repository of characteristics cast from oneself. <br> <br> In recognizing how this dual relationship is reconciled within the self, and its implications in male/female relations, Jessica Benjamin continues her exploration of intersubjectivity and gender, taking up questions of contemporary debates in feminist theory and psychoanalysis.</p><p><strong>Jessica Benjamin</strong> is a psychoanalyst in New York City, where she is on the faculty of the New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis. She is the author of <em>Bonds of Love</em> (1988) and <em>Like</em> <em>Objects, Love Objects</em> (1995).""The Shadow of the Other... is an impressive effort at building and integrating theory in the domain of feminism, gender, object relations theory, and intersubjectivity."<br>-"Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association <br>"Jessica Benjamin's latest effort to bring critical theory and psychoanalysis into a dynamic conversation results in many splendid insights. She defends her provocative claim that psychoanalysis is an extension of the Enlightenment, clarifies her own relational contribution to object-relations theory, and insists that harboring alterity within the self remains the ideal for psychic life. Along the way, she emphasizes the importance of undoing repudiations, of rewriting the oedipal and pre-oedipal in relation to gender polarity, and reminds us of the oscilliation of gender categories. In calling for a reintegration of the preoedipal into the postoedipal, she makes the matter of intersubjective recognition at once complex and urgent.."<br>-Judith Butler, University of California, Berkeley <br>..."tightly written and carefully argued."<br>-"Journal of Feminist Family Therapy <br>"A timely volume for gender studies programs, and for graduate programs with psychoanalytic components.."<br>-"Choice <br>""Shadow of the Other extends Benjamin's groundbreaking and influential studies of gender, intersubjectivity, love and aggression. Her original elaboration of intersubjectivity serves to intertwine feminism and relational psychoanalysis into a tightly woven and richly textured intellectual tapestry. What really sets Benjamin's work apart is her brilliant utilization of a systematic dialectical approach to her subject, always maintaining the delicate balance betweenopposing tensions: masculinity and femininity, subjectivity and objectivity, passivity and activity, love and aggression, fantasy and reality, modernism and postmodernism, the intrapsychic and the intersubjective. Benjamin's capacity to creatively play with intellectual ideas is unsurpassed as she continually spins concepts around, moving in new, unexpected, and surprisingly useful directions.."<br>-Lewis Aron, Ph.D., ABPP New York University Postdoctoral Program <br></p><h2>Deep Curriculum Alignment</h2><p>Why do testing and accountability efforts in today's schools fail?

St. Thomas's discourse on such topics as procedural law, judicial and advocate conduct and character, criminal and civil practice standards, and sentencing guidelines provides a blueprint for the Christian lawyer and judge by laying out the professional and ethical parameters that make the actor operate in accordance with reason and morality. This text on Thomistic jurisprudence challenges the current beliefs of law and the justice system, the functions of lawyers, advocates, and judges, and traditional views on evidence and punishment, and suggests a return to the roots of the system, in which reason, virtue, and justice guide the law and its practice. Lawyers, judges, students, and scholars should find in these pages a unique approach to renewing our beleaguered justice system.</p><p></p><p>Relying on extensive quotations from the works of St. Thomas Aquinas, the author begins the text with an explication of St. Thomas's influences, legal philosophy, and thoughts on virtue and the law.

In <em>The Rise and Fall of Peace on Earth,</em> the eminent foreign policy scholar Michael Mandelbaum examines that remarkable quarter century, describing how and why the peace was established and then fell apart. To be sure, wars took place in this era, but less frequently and on a far smaller scale than in previous periods. Mandelbaum argues that the widespread peace ended because three major countries -- Vladimir Putin's Russia in Europe, Xi Jinping's China in East Asia, and the Shia clerics' Iran in the Middle East -- put an end to it with aggressive nationalist policies aimed at overturning the prevailing political arrangements in their respective regions. The three had a common motive: their need to survive in a democratic age with their countries' prospects for economic growth uncertain. <br><br>Mandelbaum further argues that the key to the return of peace lies in the advent of genuine democracy, including free elections and the protection of religious, economic, and political liberty. Yet, since recent history has shown that democracy cannot be imposed from the outside, <em>The Rise and Fall</em> <em>of Peace on Earth</em> has a dual message: while the world has a formula for peace, there is no way to ensure that all countries will embrace it.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael Mandelbaum</strong> is the Christian A. Herter Professor Emeritus of American Foreign Policy at The Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and the author of sixteen books, including <em>Mission Failure</em>, <em>The Ideas That Conquered the World</em>, <em>The Meaning of Sports</em>, <em>The Frugal Superpower</em>, and <em>That Used to Be Us</em> (with Thomas L. Friedman).<br><br>"This book addresses the most critical foreign relations question of our times: is the post-Cold War era of peace over and conflict resurfacing? Mandelbaum expertly probes the threats and prospects." -- Azar Gat, University of Tel Aviv, and author of <em>War in Human Civilization</em><p></p><br>"In this fascinating study, Mandelbaum takes dead aim at the Wilsonian foreign policy optimism of the pre-Trump era. He argues that the post-Cold War quarter-century was indeed unusually peaceful, due to US predominance combined with the spread of market democracies, but that this liberal democratic peace has now broken down with the rise of revisionist authoritarian powers in each major region. His conclusion is thought-provoking and distinct: the democratic peace is real yet cannot be imposed." -- Colin Dueck, George Mason University, and author of <em>The Obama Doctrine</em> and <em>Hard Line</em><p></p><br>"Mandelbaum has never shied away from tackling the big questions in international politics, and he never fails to offer lucid, compelling answers. In <em>The Rise and Fall of Peace on Earth</em>, he asks why peace reigned for twenty-five years after the end of the Cold War in 1989 and why it has now begun to fray in three critical regions: Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East. His incisive explanation is presented, as always, in elegant prose." -- Rajan Menon, City University of New York, and author of <em>The Conceit of Humanitarian Intervention</em><p></p><br>"Exceptionally wise, erudite and compelling, Mandelbaum has produced the definitive record of the rise and fall of the 'deep peace.' Masterful in its historical command and judicious in the strategic lessons to be drawn, he offers cause for hope and dismay to advocates of liberal democratic capitalism everywhere. The formula for peace that works best is one the US cannot install where it is needed most. A must-read volume." -- Robert Singh, Professor of Politics, University of London, Birkbeck <br><p></p><br>"Writing with a rare combination of equanimity and incisiveness, Mandelbaum shows that while the spread of freedom and democracy around the globe has been very much to America's advantage, the United States is poorly equipped to foster the cluster of norms, habits, and institutions on which they depend in the authoritarian states currently destabilizing the international order."--<em>RealClearPolitics</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>The Rise and Fall of Peace on Earth</em> will help any reader understand what has happened in world affairs in recent decades, what is happening today, and what possibilities exist on the horizon... Mandelbaum's analysis helps to distill patterns and trends from the near chaos of daily headlines."--<em>New</em> <em>York Journal of Books</em><p></p><br>"Michael Mandelbaum is one of the most lucid American commentators on international affairs.

The text was developed for undergraduate and beginning graduate students, but it will also be of use to cognitive scientists, biologists, and psychologists who seek an introduction to biological investigations of memory. Like the first edition, this fully-updated second edition begins with a history of memory research, starting with a "Golden Era" at the turn of the 20th century, and progressing to our current understanding of the neurobiology of memory. Subsequent sections of the book discuss the cellular basis of memory, amnesia in humans and animals, the physiology of memory, declarative, procedural, and emotional memory systems, memory consolidation, and the control of memory by the prefrontal cortex.<br> The book is organized into four sections, which highlight the major themes of the text. The first theme is connection, which considers how memory is fundamentally based on alterations in the connectivity of neurons. This section of the book covers the most well studied models of cellular mechanisms of neural plasticity that may underlie memory. The second theme is cognition, which involves fundamental issues in the psychological structure of memory. This section of the book considers the competition among views on the nature of cognitive processes that underlie memory, and tells how the controversy was eventually resolved. The third theme is compartmentalization, which is akin to the classic problem of memory localization. However, unlike localization, the notion of "compartments" is intended to avoid the notion that particular memories are pigeon-holed into specific loci, and instead emphasize that different forms of memory are accomplished by distinct modules or brain systems. This section of the book surveys the evidence for multiple memory systems, and outlines how they are mediated by different brain structures and systems. The fourth and final theme is consolidation, the process by which memories are transformed from a labile trace into a permanent store.<br> This text encapsulates the major concepts in the field of memory research, and makes this area accessible to students who pursue a variety of related disciplines.<br></p><p><br>Howard Eichenbaum is Director of the Center for Memory and Brain, the Cognitive Neurobiology Laboratory, and the Center for Neuroscience at Boston University<br>. . . a wonderful textbook for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses.

He explores the nature of normativity--namely, the fact that we believe and feel we should behave in certain ways, the reasoning behind certain beliefs and emotions, and various basic features of making decisions about what to do. He goes on to consider when we are responsible for our actions and omissions, and offers a novel account of responsibility. We can think of responsibility for unjustified actions or attitudes as a precondition of the blameworthiness of a person for an attitude or an action, or perhaps for a whole set of actions, intentions, or beliefs. Responsibility for justified actions or attitudes may be a precondition of praiseworthiness. Either way responsibility may point to further consequences of being justified or unjustified, rational or not. But crucially, responsibility attaches to people in a more holistic way. Some people are responsible for their actions, while others are not. In this way, Raz argues that the end is in the beginning, in understanding how people are subject to normativity, namely how it is that there are reasons addressed to them, and what is the meaning of that for our being in the world.<br></p><p><br><strong>Joseph Raz</strong> has been teaching at Oxford University since 1972.

Yet what moral significance does it have? This book examines its morally salient features -- promise, commitment, care, and contract -- with surprising results. In Part One, "De-Moralizing Marriage," essays on promise and commitment argue that we cannot promise to love and so wedding vows are (mostly) failed promises, and that marriage may be a poor commitment strategy. The book contends with the most influential philosophical accounts of the moral value of marriage to argue that marriage has no inherent moral significance. Further, the special value accorded marriage sustains amatonormative discrimination - discrimination against non-amorous or non-exclusive caring relationships such as friendships, adult care networks, polyamorous groups, or urban tribes. The discussion raises issues of independent interest for the moral philosopher such as the possibilities and bounds of interpersonal moral obligations and the nature of commitment.<br> The central argument of Part Two, "Democratizing Marriage," is that liberal reasons for recognizing same-sex marriage also require recognition of groups, polyamorists, polygamists, friends, urban tribes, and adult care networks. Political liberalism requires the disestablishment of monogamous amatonormative marriage. Under the constraints of public reason, a liberal state must refrain from basing law solely on moral or religious doctrines; but only such doctrines could furnish reason for restricting marriage to male-female couples or romantic love dyads. Restrictions on marriage should thus be minimized. But public reason can provide a strong rationale for minimal marriage: care, and social supports for care, are a matter of fundamental justice. Part Two also responds to challenges posed by property division on divorce, polygyny, and supporting parenting, and builds on critiques of marriage drawn from feminism, queer theory, and race theory.

DuBois immortalized Philadelphia's Black Seventh Ward neighborhood, one of America's oldest urban black communities, in his 1899 sociological study The Philadelphia Negro. In the century after DuBois's study, however, the district has been transformed into a largely white upper middle class neighborhood.<br><br><em>Black Citymakers</em> revisits the Black Seventh Ward, documenting a century of banking and tenement collapses, housing activism, black-led anti-urban renewal mobilization, and post-Civil Rights political change from the perspective of the Black Seventh Warders. Drawing on historical, political, and sociological research, Marcus Hunter argues that black Philadelphians were by no means mere casualties of the large scale social and political changes that altered urban dynamics across the nation after World War II. Instead, Hunter shows that black Americans framed their own understandings of urban social change, forging dynamic inter- and intra-racial alliances that allowed them to shape their own migration from the old Black Seventh Ward to emergent black urban enclaves throughout Philadelphia. These Philadelphians were not victims forced from their homes - they were citymakers and agents of urban change.<br><br><em>Black Citymakers</em> explores a century of socioeconomic, cultural, and political history in the Black Seventh Ward, creating a new understanding of the political agency of black residents, leaders and activists in twentieth century urban change.<br></p><p><br>Marcus Anthony Hunter is Assistant Professor of Sociology, University of California, Los Angeles.<br><br>"Using the ingenious method of a neighborhood "life history," <em>Black Citymakers</em> charts more than a century of Black political agency in Philadelphia. There are no victims here, only savvy, creative, entrepreneurial, and dedicated Black Philadelphians whose proactive decisions have shaped the social geography of the city. This empirically rich, theoretically smart, and narratively elegant book charts a bold new course for the study of race and politics in urban history and sociology." --Mary Pattillo, author of <em>Black on the Block: The Politics of Race and Class in the City</em><p></p><br>"Taking W.E.B. DuBois's <em>The Philadelphia Negro</em> as its departure point, Marcus Hunter has written a wonderful book that builds on the insights of DuBois by exploring the political, social, and economic evolution of Philadelphia's Seventh Ward since DuBois's canonical study of the neighborhood. Especially attentive to the agency of black Philadelphians, Hunter demonstrates throughout the book that black residents of Philadelphia were active participants and leaders in the evolution of their neighborhood and their political power. <em>Black Citymakers</em> is a must read for all those concerned with urban and black politics today as well as those who wish to understand the transformation of Philadelphia's Seventh Ward and so many other cities across the country." --Cathy J. Cohen, author of <em>Democracy Remixed: Black Youth and the Future of American Politics</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Black Citymakers</em> is singular in its documentation of pivotal political and economic events in American history that may be less known to readers... [and] the book succeeds in illustrating how the structure-versus-agency discourse played out in real time in a specific locale. Hunter provides a deftly written, convincing portrait of urban residents actively engaged in spatial transformation as well as some of the intended and unintended consequences. Scholars and students in sociology, political science, geography, social psychology, history, and cultural studies could benefit from Hunter's extensive knowledge of the experiences of the 'Philadelphia Negro' across time." --<em>Urban Affairs Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"I recommend this work to students of urban social and economic policy for three primary reasons. First, Hunter uses historical, ethnographic methods to demonstrate the quality of black life as it relates to municipal policy in Philadelphia from 1899 to 2010... Hunter's second notable contribution... is his painstaking demonstration of the way in which blacks have been actors within the policy milieu as their position has evolved from relative weakness to relative strength... Finally, he provides a textured and well-documented rebuttal of the econometric and normative arguments that suggest benevolence and genetic inferiority are the reasons for continued socioeconomic disparities between the black minority and white minority populations." --<em>Social Science Review</em><p></p><br>"Hunter agues that the Black Seventh Ward not only encapsulated influential black political actions, but also reflected the larger political struggles of the city during the last century. This argument is an important advance for scholars who expect residents of black neighborhoods, especially those who are working class, to have had little structural impact on their cities." --<em>City &amp; Community</em> <br><p></p><br>"Hunter organizes the book around several "crucial historical moments"... He uses these episodes to illustrate his central argument that Philadelphia's black residents have been agents of change, challenging the dominant image of blacks as victims of urban renewal and as a politically homogenous group. Hunter concludes that the Black Seventh Ward inspired a new generation of black citymakers but ultimately lives on only in the collective memory of black Philadelphians. The reader is left with a more complicated picture of how the Philadelphia DuBois visited in 1896 transformed into the twenty-first-century city characterized by growth and great optimism for some and persistent poverty, violence, and failed institutions for many others." --<em>The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography</em><p></p><br>"Using four extended case studies rooted in the same geographical area of Philadelphia, Hunter shows that Philadelphia's cultural, economic, geographic, and political realities of the twentieth and twenty-first century were strongly shaped, for better and for worse, by Black agency. To speak historically without consideration of the very real human agency exhibited by all of the actors in the city, as Hunter argues, is to ignore DuBois's powerful assertion that one of the greatest flaws in sociology has been the treatment of Black people as objects and not subjects of analysis." --<em>Du</em> <em>Bois Review</em><p></p><br>"This is book well worth reading. Rich in detail, it captures in one city a pattern of urban transformation that was repeated across the nation." --<em>Ethnic and Racial Studies</em><p></p><br>"Hunter performs the kind of delicate theoretical acrobatics that make this book a significant contribution to the sociological literature on the causes, consequences, and, most important, responses to social inequality. Scholars and students interested in historical, political, and urban sociology as well as race, inequality, and social movements should read this book." --<em>American Journal of Sociology</em><p></p><br>"Hunter's investigation will motivate worthwhile debates in sociology. <em>Black Citymakers</em> may inspire sociologists to articulate just how leaders and residents of a neighborhood are, or are not, pivotal to change in a city or in the nation." --<em>Contemporary Sociology</em><p></p><br>"Hunter deftly illustrates the interdependent relationship between the political agency of black Seventh Ward residents, the racial geography of the city and the shifts in power within and around the city's political processes and institutions. While this agency did not always have the intended impact on the structural conditions that necessitated political action, Hunter's careful analysis shows the myriad of ways in which black working-class residents shaped the nation's urban centres." --<em>Urban History</em><p></p><br>"Hunter has produced a timely and timeless text highlighting Black urban political agency and subsequent shaping of urban spaces." --<em>Sociology of Race and Ethnicity</em><p></p><br>The text contributes both theoretically and empirically to the field of urban sociology, demonstrating through careful historical ethnography that 'the truly disadvantaged be also seen as citymakers' ... Students of housing, political science and urban sociology will find this text as useful as the urban historian.

Covering such basic psychoanalytic concepts as identity, transference and countertransference, the &#x2018;good-enough&#x2019; mother, the compulsion to repeat and the death instinct, James E. Groves shows how Hamlet can shed new light on understanding psychoanalytic theory, and how psychoanalysis can in turn enrich our understanding of Shakespeare&#x2019;s work. Perhaps the most radical feature of psychoanalysis is its tradition of self-examination. Mirroring it, the book throughout uses an eclectic, subjective critical approach to study how the poetry of <i>Hamlet</i> creates its realistically flawed and believably complex characters. </p> <p>Combining deep, insightful knowledge of Shakespeare and of psychoanalysis,<i> Hamlet on the Couch </i>will be of great interest to psychoanalysts and psychoanalytic psychotherapists, as well as literary scholars.</p></p><p><p><strong>James E.

It is a surprise <b>as well as a </b>bonus when he discusses not just Hamlet but also its critical tradition, including the textual arguments: he's far better informed than you would expect, better informed than most professional Shakespeareans. This book will focus and refocus people's thinking about the play on the psychological aspects of its characters, so central to its greatness, and which have been so neglected in recent sociological and historicizing criticism. Groves brings Shakespeare back to the psychological terrain which is his home, to the advantage of playwright and analyst alike. The writing is wonderful, full at once of style, brio, wit, and earnestness, a tough combo to pull off. Groves has learned much from his psychoanalytic heroes about caring for the experience of his interlocutor-in this case his readers- including their central experience of coming to understand.&nbsp;There's a lot to learn from this superb book; superb not least in the way it skilfully conveys its insights."-</em><b>William Flesch</b>, Professor of English and Comparative Literature, Brandeis University.</p></p><h2>Phonetics: Principles and Practices, Third Edition</h2><p>This fundamental text is a launching point for study in the field of phonetics.

She has removed old theological controversies and modern prejudices from the windows through which we look.

After providing a sound, nuanced picture of Paul's historical world and his place in it, before and after his transforming encounter with the risen Jesus, Pascuzzi considers Paul's writings in terms of key themes that are present and prominent in his letters. These topics are studied through examining clusters of texts in a "synthetic" approach that recognizes the range and the depth of Paul's thought. By focusing carefully on these major motifs in Paul's writings, Pascuzzi guides readers in an encounter with the foundation and superstructure of Paul's thought. The topics that she picks are uniformly pertinent to life in the twenty-first century. This study is learned without being pedantic. It is clearly conceived and written. It is engaging in the information it presents, the questions it asks, and the thinking that it promotes. Students and teachers alike will profit immensely from this work.<br>--Marion L.

Rather than attempting a comprehensive investigation into Paul's life and ministry that would overwhelm students, Pascuzzi concentrates on the most discussed and debated topics and issues in contemporary Pauline studies. She gives students easy access to Paul's Christology, soteriology, ecclesiology, and ethics as well as a precise summary of the new perspective on Paul and Paul's view of the Jewish law. Students will also find interesting her concise treatments of Paul's position on homosexuality and the role of women in church and society.

Patricio N. Abinales and Donna J. Amoroso examine the long history of institutional weakness in the Philippines and the varied strategies the state has employed to overcome its structural fragility and strengthen its bond with society. The authors argue that this process reflects the country&#x2019;s recurring dilemma: on the one hand is the state&#x2019;s persistent inability to provide essential services, guarantee peace and order, and foster economic development; on the other is the Filipinos&#x2019; equally enduring suspicions of a strong state. To many citizens, this powerfully evokes the repression of the 1970s and the 1980s that polarized society and cost thousands of lives in repression and resistance and billions of dollars in corruption, setting the nation back years in economic development and profoundly undermining trust in government.

Duterte administrations, and on issues of democratic contestation, distribution of power, gender, ethnicity, mobility, and diaspora that are transforming state-society relations. The book&#x2019;s appeal for young readers lies not only in its thoughtful, lucid overview of Filipino history, politics, and culture, but also&#x2014;and just as important&#x2014;in its reframing of the issues and debates that inform the understanding and study of our country and our people. State and Society does not lend itself to rote memorization of names, places, and events, nor does it lay down the rules for arriving at a definitive account. It is, rather, an invitation to learning, enabling students to question, test, and refine their ideas, experiences, and practices as a way of preparing themselves for engaging in the world outside their classrooms.

Rather, it is one of the most effective and innovate sets of administrative institutions of any government in the world today. Indispensable to our democracy, it keeps government reliable and dependable to the citizens it serves. However, <strong>The New Case for Bureaucracy</strong> goes beyond empirically verifying its quality. Now an extended essay, written in a conversational tone, Goodsell expects readers to form their own judgments. At a time when Congress is locked in partisan and factional deadlock, he argues for the increased importance of bureaucrats and discusses how federal agencies must battle to keep alive in terms of resources and be strong enough to retain the integrity of their missions.</p><p><p><strong>Charles T. Goodsell</strong>&nbsp;is a retired Professor Emeritus of Public Administration at the Center for Public Administration and Policy at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.&nbsp; His previous books on public administration are&nbsp;<em>Mission Mystique</em>&nbsp;(2011),&nbsp;<em>The Case for Bureaucracy</em>&nbsp;(1983, 1985, 1994, 2004),&nbsp;<em>Public Administration Illuminated and Inspired by the Arts</em>&nbsp;(co-edited, 1995),&nbsp;<em>The Public Encounter</em>&nbsp;(edited, 1981), and<em>&nbsp;Administration of&nbsp;a Revolution</em>&nbsp;(1965).&nbsp; Other works include&nbsp;<em>The American Statehouse</em>&nbsp;(2001),<em>&nbsp;The Social Meaning of Civic Space</em>&nbsp;(1988), and&nbsp;<em>American Corporations and Peruvian Politics&nbsp;</em>(1974).&nbsp; He has lectured and spoken on bureaucracy throughout the United States and in Canada, Mexico, Great Britain, Australia, and China.&nbsp;He&nbsp;has published 13 books over a 60-year career and is one of the nation&#x2032;s best known advocates for American public service. He was a founding faculty member of Virginia Tech&#x2032;s Center for Public Administration and Policy, and retired in 2002, but continues writing.</p><p><br></p><p>"This book is one of the few that expressly takes on the myths of bureaucracy. With greater conservatism in&nbsp;Congress and in the media, these myths have&nbsp;received enough attention to be seen as truths to a significant portion of the American public; even some political science textbooks propagate the myths.&nbsp;Dr. Goodsell&#x2032;s book counters those&nbsp;stereotypes&nbsp;by using empirical data to argue for the bureaucracy and the critical role that administrators play in the American political system."</p> Author: Kimberly Nelson<br><br><p>"The book&#x2019;s primary strength is the force of the argument put forth by the author in support of the U.S. bureaucracy. Since many of my students will go on to public careers, this book provides them with a strong positive argument for their future careers. It also does a great job of debunking the myths with data and analysis."</p> Author: Mark Morris<br><br>"Goodsell debunks pejorative bureaucratic myths about governance at the national, state, and local levels by placing them under an intellectual and pragmatic microscope.&nbsp;At a time when Congress and elected officials have the lowest approval ratings in history, Goodsell expertly examines the new bureaucratic realities with a focus on the earned trust in public servants who wisely use their administrative discretion to ensure the institutions of government are responsive to the demands of the citizenry; while ensuring their capacity to function are preserved and protected.&nbsp; His new case for bureaucracy is a must read for those who desire to know the truth about our valued public servants."

RICHARD SIPE is a Certified Clinical Mental Health Counselor who earlier spent 18 years as a Benedictine monk and priest. He was trained specifically to deal with the mental health problems of Roman Catholic Priests. In the process of training and therapy, he conducted a 25-year ethnographic study of the celibate/sexual behavior of that population. His study, published in 1990, is now considered a classic. Sipe is known internationally and has participated in 12 documentaries on celibacy and priest sexual abuse aired by HBO, BBC, and other networks in the United States, United Kingdom, and France. He has been widely interviewed by media including CNN, ABC, NBC, CNBC, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, People magazine, Newsweek and USA Today.Sipe, a psychotherapist and former priest, reexamines the Roman Catholic Church's policy of mandatory clerical celibacy in light of the recently exposed sexual misconduct scandals. Placing the evolution of the celibacy concept firmly in historical context, the author provides the background information necessary for a contemporary analysis. Using hundreds of candid interviews conducted with priests, their sexual partners, and victims of clerical sexual abuse, he provides overwhelming evidence of the physical and spiritual failure of the celibacy ideal. Significantly, he enfolds this discussion within the archaic position of the church on human sexuality in general, arguing persuasively that the two issues are intimately and inextricably entwined. Though the frank nature of the first-person narratives may disturb some readers, others will welcome this objective exploration of a religious crisis centuries in the making. <i>Margaret Flanagan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

They take account of the fact that labor relations are much more politicized in emerging countries than in advanced industrialized countries. They also address the traditional role played by state-dominated unions in emerging countries and the recent increased importance of independent unions that have emerged as alternatives. These independent unions tend to promote firm- or workplace-level collective bargaining in contrast to the more traditional top-down systems. Katz, Kochan, and Colvin explain how multinational corporations, nongovernmental organizations, and other groups that act across national borders increasingly influence work and employment outcomes.</p></p><p><p>Harry C.

Here are the fundamental concepts of matrix algebra, first in an intuitive framework and then in a more formal manner. A Variety of interpretations and applications of the elements and operations considered are included. In particular, the use of matrices in the study of transformations of the plane is stressed. The purpose of this book is to familiarize the reader with the role of matrices in abstract algebraic systems, and to illustrate its effective use as a mathematical tool in geometry. <br>The first two chapters cover the basic concepts of matrix algebra that are important in the study of physics, statistics, economics, engineering, and mathematics. Matrices are considered as elements of an algebra. The concept of a linear transformation of the plane and the use of matrices in discussing such transformations are illustrated in Chapter #. Some aspects of the algebra of transformations and its relation to the algebra of matrices are included here. The last chapter on eigenvalues and eigenvectors contains material usually not found in an introductory treatment of matrix algebra, including an application of the properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors to the study of the conics. Considerable attention has been paid throughout to the formulation of precise definitions and statements of theorems. The proofs of most of the theorems are included in detail in this book. <i>Matrices and Transformations</i> assumes only that the reader has some understanding of the basic fundamentals of vector algebra. Pettofrezzo gives numerous illustrative examples, practical applications, and intuitive analogies. There are many instructive exercises with answers to the odd-numbered questions at the back. The exercises range from routine computations to proofs of theorems that extend the theory of the subject. Originally written for a series concerned with the mathematical training of teachers, and tested with hundreds of college students, this book can be used as a class or supplementary text for enrichments programs at the high school level, a one-semester college course, individual study, or for in-service programs.</p><p></p><h2>Coaching with Spirit</h2><p>Coaching with Spirit is an uncommon resource that shows you how to enhance your effectiveness by integrating spirituality into your professional interactions with clients.

Lured by the promise of riches, thousands of settlers left behind the forests, rain, and fertile soil of the eastern United States in favor of the rough-hewn lands of the American West. The dramatic terrain they struggled to cross is so familiar to us now that it is hard to imagine how frightening&#x2014;even godforsaken&#x2014;its sheer rock faces and barren deserts seemed to our forebears.<br> <i> </i></p> <p><i>Hard Road West</i> brings their perspective vividly to life, weaving together the epic overland journey of the covered wagon trains and the compelling story of the landscape they encountered. Taking readers along the 2,000-mile California Trail, Keith Meldahl uses the diaries and letters of the settlers themselves&#x2014;as well as the countless hours he has spent following the trail&#x2014;to reveal how the geology and geography of the West directly affected our nation&#x2019;s westward expansion.

Plump sausages sputtering on the grill, thick bacon sizzling in a pan, a juicy pork chop from the oven-pork comes in so many wondrous forms. From grilling and frying to braising and pickling, author Libbie Summers has a special way with pork, taking comfortable old-fashioned dishes and updating them with fun and stylish twists. <br>Summers grew up on a hog farm in Missouri-even wrestling pigs as a kid at the state fair-and grew to become the culinary producer for Paula Deen, who instilled in her a Southerner&#x2019;s affection for the pig.&nbsp; Most of her recipes have a down-home accent, but many reflect international influences too: Sweet Tea Brined Pork Shoulder, Pork Chops and Applesauce, Pork Belly Gyros, Pork Pies, and Jerk Roasted Tenderloin. Chapters are divided according to primal cuts, such as the shoulder, loin, bacon, and ribs. How-to sections show you how to make your own fresh sausage, tie up a crown roast, and cure bacon.

In their engaging foreword, Walter and Ruthanne Wangerin describe their practice of prayerand the compelling role prayer has played in their relationship. In addition, they suggest helpful, creative ways spouses can use the book together. <p>Prayers are grouped under six major headings: Daily Living as Husband and Wife, Love and Loving, Times of Suffering, For the Faith of My Spouse, Roles as Children and as Parents, and Traveling. Topics and occasions for the prayers are as universaland as personalas the experiences of marriage partners everywhere. The Wangerins offer a collection of prayer litanies that turn everyday events into shared, sacred occasions and make special events even more meaningful. The final section of the book provides marriage partners with simple step-by-step instructions for a private, yearly retreat that can renew and refresh their love for one another and their faith in God.</p></p><p>From the Foreword (pre-publication version): <p>On Marriage and Prayer </p><p>Thanne and I have been married for thirty-two years. Vigorous years. Our marriage has been a story of calm days, common days, days of a sudden and blinding transcendence; we&#x2019;ve sinned and confessed and forgiven; there have been trips and children, emergency rooms, schoolrooms, courtrooms, and through it all&#x2014;through the daily round of human duties&#x2014;faith. Our faith, yes; but more surely than that, the faithfulness of heaven. </p><p>God has been the deeper love and the ground of our marriage, always. But I myself&#x2014;I did not always acknowledge that. Nor did I always take advantage of the sweet communion of prayer. </p><p>Thanne has. And it was Thanne who persuaded me to pray out loud with her. </p><p>Within days of our wedding, I began studies at Concordia Seminary in preparation for ministry, and Thanne began her profession as a teacher. Those were hard times for her. Often, in visible stress, she would say, &#x201c;Wally, we should pray together.&#x201d; </p><p>I didn&#x2019;t disagree. But neither did I actually agree. </p><p>I&#x2019;m not sure why. Perhaps because, though my father was a pastor, I never experienced spontaneous prayer before. We&#x2019;d only prayed formal prayers&#x2014;as Thanne and I did at mealtimes now. And I think I was embarrassed by the danger of prayer: revealing myself, inverting the truer truth of myself before Jesus and Thanne together. </p><p>But in those days I was an angry young man, angry for causes I couldn&#x2019;t see&#x2014;so neither could I see the anger in me. Thanne did, of course. Thanne suffered my fits of gloom. And sometimes I saw that: her suffering. And when I knew that I had hurt her, I grieved. </p><p>&#x201c;Thanne,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Thanne,&#x201d; I begged her in the heat of my shame, &#x201c;what can I do to make it up? What can I do to prove I love you?&#x201d; </p><p>One day, when I was in deepest need of her forgiveness, the opportunistic Ruthanne said, &#x201c;Pray with me, Wally. Pray out loud with me.&#x201d; </p><p>I was caught. I could not avoid the issue. </p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; </p><p>But I was the seminary student. I knew about God. So I took us into the bedroom and said we should lie down on the bed. We did. Side by side. </p><p>But I felt breathless. Nervous. &#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; I cried. I jumped up and turned off the light. Somehow this praying thing seemed as awkward and exposed as the first time we made love together. </p><p>&#x201c;Now, then.&#x201d; I went first. </p><p>I gathered my thoughts, cleared my throat, then, in the darkness, began to fashion a formal, literate prayer. Petitions. Bible verses. I surprised myself. My voice grew strong. See, Thanne? See? I can do this after all. I succeeded very well in sounding like a preacher in the pulpit. </p><p>When I finished there was a silence. Had she fallen asleep? </p><p>No, she hadn&#x2019;t. </p><p>Quietly Thanne began to pray, with no more force or formality than when she talks softly to me at night. But she was talking to Jesus. It seemed as if I weren&#x2019;t even there. Jesus was close, intimate to her. Jesus was all. And I felt a little like a peeping Tom, not so much hearing her prayer as over-hearing it. </p><p>I was ashamed. My brazen prayer was only a crashing cymbal next to the common honesty of her language. And I realized that I had, in effect, prayed to her, prayed for her approval, while she was praying to Jesus, for Jesus&#x2019; blessed response. </p><p>And then, still in her tender and sacred conversation, Thanne began to tell the Lord Jesus about &#x201c;Wally.&#x201d; About me. As if I were so important that Jesus should take care of me. And in that moment, in the darkness, I started to cry.</p>Walter Wangerin Jr. has won numerous awards and honors for his books.

Sometimes I indulge in fantasies that would bring most women over the edge. A hot guy with his face buried between my legs, his muscular arms wrapped around my open thighs; that sexy professor from my undergrad poli sci class, bending me over the desk in his office; even Robert Downey, Jr., and Chris Evans inviting me into an Avengers three-way and proving they have superpowers of their own.</p><p>None of it gets me off. Every time, my fantasies ultimately bring me back to my most secret shame. The hands that caress me hold me down; the moan of satisfaction I imagine turn into screams for help, screams no one hears. As the fantasy becomes more savage, more brutal, I glory in it more and more.</p><p>And in the end, I only come when I imagine being raped.</p><p>I loathe this about myself. Rape is a vicious criminal act, one that makes the victim feel like a hollowed-out, broken <i>thing</i>; I should know. Countless self-help books, sex toys, and therapy sessions have taught me more about why I have these fantasies. They&#x2019;ve also taught me that lots of people get off on this&#x2014;female and male. But my desires still betray me, own me.</p><p>For a long time I kept my needs secret. My boyfriends had no idea what I was imagining behind my closed eyes while they were inside me. Once I tried to tell my ex-boyfriend Geordie about it&#x2014;lightly, playing it as no more than a kinky whim&#x2014;but that was a kink we didn&#x2019;t share. He couldn&#x2019;t go along, not even for me, and I wound up feeling humiliated and even more ashamed than before.</p><p>But I&#x2019;m glad I told Geordie. Because in a drunken haze at a party months later, he blurted out my secret. Most of the people who overheard him snickered or leered, knowing only that I wanted to try something crazy in bed.</p><p>One man heard the truth even Geordie hadn&#x2019;t understood. One man realized exactly what I wanted, and how I wanted it.</p><p>Jonah Marks understood because he wanted it too.</p><p>We began a sexual relationship built on our shared secret. At first we tried to remain unknown to each other, coming together only as strangers, to intensify the fantasy. Jonah understood what I needed and how to give it to me. He let me become a victim; I let him become a monster. And yet we always stayed within the limits we&#x2019;d set. He understood how to walk the line that let me feel scared and safe at once.</p><p>Over time, though, we were no longer strangers. We knew only one thing about each other&#x2014;but it was the most intimate thing anyone could know. We had looked into each other&#x2019;s souls.</p><p>Finally we saw too much. Saw the truth. Jonah pulled back. Now he&#x2019;s lost to me&#x2014;for now, and maybe forever.</p><p>But not if I can help it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>One</p><p>Normally I don&#x2019;t worry much about walking across campus to my car. My schedule as a graduate teaching assistant allows me to leave before dark most of the time, and the University of Texas at Austin is one of the biggest colleges in the nation, meaning people are usually around.</p><p>However, this is the Saturday night after Thanksgiving. Most students are still at home with their families. Professors too. Me, I left New Orleans sooner than I&#x2019;d planned. The enormous pile of research papers I had to grade could&#x2019;ve been split into a couple of days&#x2019; work, but I was close enough to finishing this evening to keep on to the end.</p><p>That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m walking across a nearly deserted campus, not far from downtown, at 11 o&#x2019;clock at night.</p><p>A white truck drives along the nearest road. Its headlights sweep past me, and I blink against the glare. For a moment I think the truck might be about to stop, and I wonder if it&#x2019;s stopping for me. But then it drives on, and I breathe out a sigh of relief.</p><p>The world spends so much time telling women how not to be raped&#x2014;more time than it spends telling men not to rape. So I remind myself that I know what to do. I keep my head up. I look around me so that I&#x2019;m alert and aware of my surroundings. No earbuds to deafen me to the sound of approaching footsteps, no phone in hand to distract me with texts or games. What I&#x2019;m wearing shouldn&#x2019;t attract undue attention: denim skirt, wine-colored cardigan. And I&#x2019;ve got on flats I could run in, if I had to.</p><p>And I also know to meet the eyes of any man I see, so he&#x2019;ll realize I&#x2019;ve registered his presence. That I could identify him later.</p><p>Which is why, when I hear the dull thud of boots on the ground near me, I turn my head&#x2014;and stop in my tracks.</p><p>The man walking so close is tall, six-foot-two or -three. Muscular too, as his low-slung jeans and tight-fitting shirt reveal. Yet he&#x2019;s not some bodybuilder type; his waist is almost impossibly narrow beneath such broad shoulders, his neck long. His proportions suggest both brutality and fragility. One glance would tell anyone this man is stretched to the breaking point, and make you wonder what he&#x2019;d do if he broke. In the bluish glare of the streetlight, his features are almost too beautiful to be rugged, but not quite. Straight nose, high cheekbones like slashes, his thin-lipped mouth set in a firm line. One of his broad hands could circle my throat. The description for the police would begin <i>Caucasian, fair skin, dark hair cropped short, clean-shaven</i>. His eyes are the shade of steel.</p><p>And they are locked on me.</p><p>I felt so sure of myself a few moments ago. So strong and prepared. Now I see myself as an attacker would. A woman in her midtwenties, all alone, weighed down by a messenger bag stuffed with seven pounds of papers. The bag&#x2019;s strap cuts diagonally across my torso, pressing my sweater tightly against my breasts. Nobody else is within sight or hearing. My car must be at least a hundred feet away.</p><p>If he wanted to come at me, nobody could stop him. Not even me.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re out late,&#x201d; he says, his deep voice tight. Tense.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you know.&#x201d; The kind of meaningless nonstatement we all make to strangers. I shrug the messenger bag behind me. I could run easier that way. But the strap only twists my cardigan, sliding the hem up enough to bare a few inches of my skin to the cool night air. Our endless Texas summer has finally ended; the chill has come.</p><p>But I&#x2019;m not shivering with the cold.</p><p>It&#x2019;s anticipation.</p><p>&#x201c;Girls shouldn&#x2019;t walk around outside late at night,&#x201d; he says, stepping closer. The streetlight elongates his shadow; the dark line of it slices across the ground between us. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s dangerous.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Walking isn&#x2019;t dangerous,&#x201d; I retort. &#x201c;People are.&#x201d;</p><p>His voice deepens further, almost a growl. &#x201c;Yes. So why are you out here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to my car.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You could&#x2019;ve gone home anytime you liked.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s speaking to me stranger to stranger, like a naughty little girl he has the right to chastise. &#x201c;But you stayed late, on purpose. So you could walk out here all alone.&#x201d;</p><p>My breath catches in my throat. The mood between us shifts by the instant.</p><p>And then it turns sharp as a knife as he finishes, &#x201c;Some people would say you were begging for it.&#x201d;</p><p>The possibilities multiply within my mind, a pornographic kaleidoscope. He could force me into his car, or mine. Hold me down in the backseat, rip off my panties, and fuck me senseless. Or maybe he&#x2019;ll play it cooler, offer to give me a ride on a cold night, swear to act like a gentleman. But instead of dropping me off as he&#x2019;d promised, he forces his way into my house, ties me up, and does whatever he wants with me, for hours. He could even drag me down right here.</p><p>Any other woman would go for her phone. Or scream. Or run.</p><p>Instead I stand there, drinking him in. The other edge of fear is desire, and it&#x2019;s desire that has me now. Not only desire&#x2014;lust. I don&#x2019;t care how cold the night is; I don&#x2019;t care how dangerous it would be. I just want <i>him</i>, so badly I&#x2019;ll do anything.</p><p>And he wants me just as much. I can tell by the way his jaw clenches, by how he keeps trying not to look at me but still can&#x2019;t resist.</p><p>We have become hunter and prey.</p><p><i>Come on, Jonah, </i>I think as I look at the man I have feared and fought and maybe begun to love. <i>Let go. Take me.</i></p><p>He takes one step forward&#x2014;and then we both freeze as the white truck circles around again and stops nearby. Someone leans out the open driver&#x2019;s side window; through the glare of the headlights I recognize a friend of a friend, this guy named Mack. &#x201c;Hey, Vivienne!&#x201d; he calls. &#x201c;You need a ride to your car?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m good!&#x201d; I answer. I would&#x2019;ve turned the ride down no matter what. Mack&#x2019;s always struck me as the stereotypical frat bro, hardly my type. Then again, when he saw me walking around alone and vulnerable late at night, he tried to help out. Maybe I misjudged the guy.</p><p>Doesn&#x2019;t change the fact that right now I could scream at him for interrupting Jonah and me.</p><p>Mack simply waves before he puts his car back in drive and heads out, leaving me alone with Jonah again. But it&#x2019;s too late.</p><p>The spell has been broken, the game ended. I look into Jonah&#x2019;s eyes and what I see there is not desire. Not only desire, anyway. What I see most strongly is pain.</p><p>Very quietly he says, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not doing this. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Damn</i> it. &#x201c;You started it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because you make me lose control.&#x201d; Jonah half-turns from me, giving the lie to his own words. This man has <i>iron</i> self-control. I wish he didn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Vivienne, you know why we have to stop.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one with the&#x2014;&#x201d; But what do I say? <i>Hang-up </i>is too trivial; <i>problem</i> too judgmental. The truth would be closer to <i>wound</i>, or <i>scar</i>. Yet the last thing he wants is my pity.</p><p>More resolutely, he continues, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t play for a while. Maybe not ever. I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Not ever?</i> He can&#x2019;t think like that. We&#x2019;ll never find an answer if he&#x2019;s not even looking for it. &#x201c;Jonah&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I just can&#x2019;t do it to you. Not knowing what I know.&#x201d; His shoulders slump, like he&#x2019;s been carrying a tremendous weight for far too long. &#x201c;It changes things.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not protecting me with this, you know. Maybe you think you are, but all you&#x2019;ve done is make me ashamed.&#x201d; Jonah Marks was the first person who ever got me past that shame, who gave me the freedom to own my desires. Having that ripped away from me aches with an almost physical pain.</p><p>&#x201c;Vivienne&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You decided I&#x2019;m too fragile to touch. Which is what broke me.&#x201d; My voice cracks. &#x201c;Ironic, huh?&#x201d;</p><p>I walk past him, hurrying to my Honda Civic. I toss the heavy messenger bag in ahead of me, get in, slam the door. Jonah stands in the distance&#x2014;watching me to make sure I get in the car safely. He punishes me and protects me; that&#x2019;s the paradox of the man.</p><p>That same paradox is now tearing both of us apart, from each other and within ourselves.</p><p>As I put the car in reverse and pull out, I catch one last glimpse of Jonah in the rearview mirror. He&#x2019;s staring after me with an expression so bruised that, despite my anger, my heart hurts for him.</p><p>But whatever he&#x2019;s feeling isn&#x2019;t enough to make him come after me, and I drive off into the darkness alone.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Two</p><p>My therapist deserves a raise.</p><p>Doreen leans back in her easy chair. &#x201c;Are you surprised your meeting with Jonah didn&#x2019;t end the way you wanted?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It <i>began</i> the way I wanted, and then we got interrupted.&#x201d; Jonah wanted it as badly as I did, if not more. I know that in my bones. &#x201c;But I should&#x2019;ve realized he wouldn&#x2019;t follow through regardless.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why so?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because I thought he&#x2019;d put aside all his misgivings so we could fix our problems with sex,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;When our problem <i>is</i> the sex.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jonah thinks so.&#x201d;</p><p>I curl my sock-clad feet under me on the sofa. Doreen makes her patients leave shoes at the door, probably to make us feel less formal, more comfortable. It works too. None of the other psychologists I&#x2019;ve talked to over the years were able to put me at ease, but Doreen&#x2019;s practice is different. Her office is a sunny, cozy room in the corner of her house. Instead of the usual diplomas and certifications on the walls, she decorates with thriving houseplants and African art.</p><p>We broke off our sessions for a few weeks, just before Jonah and I hit the shoals. Doreen prodded me a little too hard about my fixation on my rape fantasy. I didn&#x2019;t want to hear it; honestly, I still don&#x2019;t. But when I came back to her, she understood. Doreen&#x2019;s wise enough to know when to let something go for a while, and when to remain quiet so that I&#x2019;m forced to find the truth that fills the silence.</p><p>Which is what she&#x2019;s doing now.</p><p>&#x201c;Jonah and I have both struggled with our fantasies. Neither of us has ever come to peace with what we want, or why we want it. But when we were together, living it out&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t feel so guilty and ashamed anymore. Jonah was so careful to make me feel safe. We set our boundaries, and he never, ever violated them. He never would. So when I was with him, I could let go. Completely.&#x201d;</p><p>Doreen nods. &#x201c;You established trust and intimacy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We thought we were being so smart,&#x201d; I murmur, almost to myself. &#x201c;Like we could wall off that part of our lives and preserve the fantasy. But we didn&#x2019;t understand what we were getting into.&#x201d;</p><p>That first night together had been brutal, terrifying, and perfect. Jonah had wrecked me&#x2014;ripped my clothes from my body, forced me to my knees, thrown me down onto the hotel room desk, and fucked me mercilessly. I came harder than I&#x2019;d ever come in my life, crying out even as he pounded into me. The sound had made him laugh in triumph. In that moment, Jonah owned me, and he knew it.</p><p>But afterward, as I trembled and struggled to catch my breath, Jonah had held me tenderly. He&#x2019;d brought me water, made sure I was okay, and gave me one of the gentlest kisses I&#x2019;ve ever known.</p><p>That kiss was my first hint that I&#x2019;d found more than my ultimate sexual partner. In Jonah I had discovered something far more rare.</p><p>&#x201c;So you expanded that relationship,&#x201d; Doreen says, bringing me back to the now. &#x201c;It seemed to be working for a while.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When he came home to New Orleans with me, it changed everything.&#x201d; I sit up straighter, energized by the memory of righteous anger. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t just that he was there for me when we were so scared about Dad&#x2014;I mean, it was that too. But Jonah stood up to my family. He saw through the lies. For once, just once, finally someone was <i>on my side</i> and it made all the difference in the world.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your family betrayed you.&#x201d;</p><p>Doreen is simply telling the truth. Yet even after all these years I find it hard to put it that bluntly. Instead I shrug, folding my arms atop my knees. &#x201c;They took Anthony&#x2019;s side.&#x201d;</p><p>She shakes her head. &#x201c;They took their own. The side of convenience and luxury and denial. They chose to believe what was easy instead of what was hard and true, and they didn&#x2019;t give a damn about what it did to you.&#x201d;</p><p>Even Doreen has rarely put it that harshly before. I find it bracing. &#x201c;Jonah saw the truth without ...</p></p><h2>Why Not Say What Happened?: A Memoir</h2><p><p>Born into one of the most celebrated Anglo-Irish families, the Guinnesses, Ivana Lowell grew up at the whim of two literary heavyweights&#x2014;her mother, writer Lady Caroline Blackwood, and stepfather, poet Robert Lowell. <br><br>Now, with an incisive eye and a wicked sense of humor, she shares the stories we&#x2019;ve always wanted to hear. She tells of following the famous authors from one crumbling, drafty country house to another, and of summers spent with madcap relatives such as her maternal grandmother, the Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava, and her &#x201c;old friend,&#x201d; the Queen Mother. But Ivana also has darker stories to tell: about her childhood accident, about her own stints in rehab, and, finally, about discovering the secret Lady Caroline had successfully kept from Ivana her entire life.</p></p><p>Ivana Lowell grew up in London, Boston, and New York. She now lives in Sag Harbor with her daughter.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>I have recently started going to a new shrink. She is the latest on a list of many. She is British, straightforward, and cozily plump. The sort of woman you want to sit down with, have a nice cup of tea and a bit of a chat. "You have been so bumped and knocked around," she told me after hearing just a little of my history, "that it's a wonder you survived at all."<br><br>I certainly don't feel like a "wonder." In fact, I feel that I have fucked up my life. I have spent so long trying to avoid feeling the pain and anxiety that lie so close to the surface of my skin. Alcohol, antidepressants, and stints in rehabs have done little to alleviate the feelings of desperation.<br><br>The worst thought I have is that it is too late, that perhaps I am too damaged ever to be fixed. I have spent so much of my life floundering.<br><br>Now that I am a mother, however, I have grown up a bit and become brave enough to look back and try to make some sense of the past.<br><br>Dysfunctional does not even begin to describe my family and upbringing. Anyway, that is far too easy a word to use-who doesn't come from some kind of dysfunction? But what part of my history has so ill-equipped me to function in adulthood?<br><br>"You do know who your real father was. Don't you?" Maybe I had been given a clue to solve a puzzle that I never knew even existed.<br><br>on paper it all looks so perfect, so glamorous, so privileged, and interesting. I come from a fabled background. My mother was born into a family that was wealthy, aristocratic, and good-looking. My grandmother was one of three sisters whom the society pages dubbed "the glorious Guinness girls." All three were beautiful, charming, and, thanks to the popularity of the black stout beer whose name they bore, very rich.<br><br>They were also spoiled, selfish, and uneducated. They were born during an era when it was deemed unnecessary for a young lady to be equipped with anything other than nice manners and good child-bearing hips. Education was considered unimportant.<br><br>My great-grandfather the Honorable Arthur Edward Guinness was by all accounts an unattractive character. I have heard many stories that illustrate his extravagant and boorish behavior. My mother's favorite was when "Granddaddy" purchased his own private airplane. He knew very little about flying but on a whim one day decided to take the plane out for a little spin. Unfortunately, when he jumped into the cockpit he failed to notice that the plane's mechanic was still working on top of one of the wings. The mechanic was killed immediately after the plane took off, but my great-grandfather ignored this little inconvenience and continued his flight undaunted. Because of his great wealth some of these more despicable acts were labeled as merely eccentric, and as far as I know he never suffered any repercussions or consequences.<br><br>At that time he also owned one of the largest yachts ever built. He decided that his girls should see the world, and so he embarked with my grandmother and my two great-aunts on a sailing trip that lasted most of their formative years. Their lives up to that point had been untouched by reality, and the long<br><br>sea voyage only removed them further from any semblance of normality.<br><br>As a young girl my grandmother was waited on hand and foot, a practice that she made sure continued until her death at ninety-four. If she needed to go to the lavatory, a maid would warm up the toilet seat before "Miss Maureen" was allowed to sit down.<br><br>When the girls came out as debutantes, they were in possession of cash and good looks, but they needed class to be accepted at the highest level of English society. My grandmother found it in the form of the Marquess of Dufferin and Ava. Basil Dufferin was young, handsome, and eligible. His grandfather the first marquess had been viceroy in India and governor general of Canada. He had arguably been Britain's most accomplished diplomat of the nineteenth century. Basil himself had done brilliantly at Oxford and was generally expected to go on to do great things.<br><br>The huge society marriage between the dashing young marquess and the vivacious Guinness heiress at Saint Margaret's Cathedral in London was seemingly made in Debrett's heaven.<br><br>along with his title, my grandfather had inherited a large, gray stone Georgian house and estate in the north of Ireland. On a man-made shamrock-shaped lake and surrounded by acres and acres of parkland, Clandeboye House was the childhood home of my mother and her younger sister and brother.<br><br>After the three children were born, their glamorous parents continued their exhaustive socializing and entertaining. Both were overly fond of drink (something that is a recurring theme in my family), and they were at the epicenter of the decadent, hedonistic social life of London in the 1930s.<br><br>My grandparents and their set cavorted with the fastest, grandest, and most brilliant people that England had to offer, statesmen, royalty, literary figures, and a scattering of talented snobs. Cecil Beaton, Evelyn Waugh, Frederick Ashton, and N�el Coward were part of their crowd. When Cecil Beaton met my grandmother Maureen and her sisters, Oonagh and Eileen, in the 1920s, he records, "It was disgustingly smart and so dreadfully like the party in a No�l Coward play." In the No�l Coward song "I Went to a Marvelous Party," there is a bit about Maureen:<br><br>I went to a marvelous party<br><br>We played the most wonderful game.<br><br>Maureen disappeared<br><br>And came back in a beard<br><br>And we all had to guess at her name!<br><br>While my grandparents were enjoying the high life in London, my mother, my aunt, and my uncle were left in the austere atmosphere of Northern Ireland. They were looked after by governesses and nannies. My mother would never forgive her mother for her lack of parental love, the loneliness she felt as a child, and the brutal disregard with which she and her siblings were treated. She never forgave my grandmother for this neglect, and in many ways she spent the rest of her life trying to escape from the cruel and empty world of her aristocratic childhood.<br><br>When England declared war on Germany, everyone's circumstances changed dramatically. The children were considered to be safer in Ireland, away from the blitzing of England, rather than at the Knightsbridge house in Hans Crescent. This only increased my mother's feeling of isolation.<br><br>Even my grandmother did her bit to help out the war effort, joining the Red Cross and consoling wounded young soldiers. She would remind us of this in self-sacrificing tones for years to come. My grandfather Basil, who had been the secretary of state for war in 1935, persuaded the war office to dispatch him to Burma on an operation aimed at demoralizing the Japanese troops who were steadily advancing.<br><br>My mother said that he had volunteered partly to prove that he was more than just a privileged aristocrat. But she suspected his real reason was to escape from my grandmother. She told me that her father had begun to find Maureen's obsession with royalty and her relentless party giving and socializing tedious. Her father, she said, was a "funny, clever and well-educated man," and Maureen was-"Well, she was the opposite of that, wasn't she?"<br><br>It was a dangerous and brave mission for him to undertake and on March 25, 1945, Lord Dufferin was killed in action. He was thirty-five. One of the ironies of his death was that it took place near the ancient capital of Ava, his namesake, and in the country that his grandfather had annexed to the British throne.<br><br>His death left Maureen a widow with two young daughters and a son. My uncle Sheridan, aged three years old, was now the Fifth Marquess of Dufferin and Ava and the heir to the Clandeboye estate.</p><h2>EXILES VOL. 2: THE TRIAL OF THE EXILES</h2><p>The reality-hopping adventurers continue their exploits across the Marvel Multiverse!

The game took hold in Philadelphia, where players founded the U.S. Squash Racquets Association in 1904, and became one of the primary pastimes of the nation's elite. Squash launched a U.S. Open in 1954, but its present boom started in the 1970s when commercial squash clubs took the sport public. In the 1980s a pro tour sprung up to offer tournaments on portable glass courts in dramatic locales such as the Winter Garden at the World Trade Center. <br> James Zug, with access to private archives and interviews with hundreds of players, describes the riveting moments and sweeping historical trends that have shaped the game. He focuses on the biographies of legendary squash personalities: Eleo Sears, the Boston Brahmin who swam in the cold Atlantic before matches; Hashim Khan, the impish founder of the Khan dynasty; Victor Niederhoffer, the son of a Brooklyn cop; and Mark Talbott, a Grateful Dead groupie who traveled the pro circuit sleeping in the back of his pickup. A gripping cultural history, <i>Squash</i> is the book for which all aficionados of this fast-paced, exciting game have been waiting.</p><p><b>James Zug</b> was born in Philadelphia in 1969. He captained the squash team at Dartmouth College. A senior writer at <i>Squash Magazine,</i> he has written for <i>The Atlantic Monthly,</i> <i>Outside,</i> <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> and <i>Tennis Week.</i> He holds a master?s in nonfiction writing from Columbia University and lives with his wife in Washington, D.C.<b>Prologue</b> <p> Schoolboys created the game out of three simple things. They swung crude racquets shaved off at the handle. They hit gray rubber balls, sticky, misshapen, punctured, smelling of brimstone. They battered stone walls stippled with windows, ledges and pipes. Three items were the sole prerequisites, and a century and a half later it is the same: a bat, a ball and a wall. </p><p> Squash breeds zealots. People fall in love with the game to the point of obsession. Something about it captures the imagination. Each of the tripartite aspects of squash is so basic and so uncomplicated that the love runs pure and deep. Time does not leaven the passion. Decades later a squash player can instantly retrieve the memory of that first day he connected on the sweet spot of a racquet and drove a squash ball hard into a wall. </p><p> The bat, as a racquet used to be called, is the chief tool of the squash tradesman. At first it was a sawed-off bamboo stick. As the game grew in sophistication, it became a hoop of second-growth white ash, bent by steam, strung with gut and red silk cord, with a pillowy calfskin grip at one end and the stern admission on the side: Squash Racquet Not Guaranteed. Prossers. Wright &amp; Ditson. Spalding. Bancroft. Snauwaert. Cragin. Feron. Unsquashable. Manta. Slazenger. Dunlop. Wilson. Head. Prince. Today racquets are made from high modulous graphite, hyper carbon and titanium. They swoosh through the air with oversized heads, with a powerscoop shaft, microfilament, eighteen-gauge nylon Ashaway strings and a cushion-fit faux-leather grip. The bat is long and light, but capable of delivering satisfying force upon the ball. </p><p> King Arthur obtained Excalibur from a beautiful woman who stood sentry at the shores of a lake in which the sword was submerged; a squash player's relationship to his weapon is equally shrouded in the mists of romantic myth. It is a scythe you swing in a white field, a rapier that cuts to the quick, a rifle for a soldier, a hammer for a carpenter. You envelop your bat in a fetishistic aura. You pamper it. You kiss it after a lucky shot. You grip and regrip it, winding wafer-thin blue ribbons around the handle, tying them off with a red stick of tape. You bandage the head with protective tape. You tap it against the wall before you serve, like a blind man touching the sidewalk with a cane. It gives your bearings. You string and restring, and you straighten the strings in between points like a master weaver. You are loath to let someone borrow it. You are superstitious and save a magical racquet for crucial matches. You stick it first into your squash bag when you go away for a tournament. When you come back, you stash it head down in your locker. Squash is a tough sport. Racquets split and crack. Players retire. Memories fade into the back corners of the mind. When your racquet finally breaks, you do not throw it away. You bury it in an upstairs closet to be found by a grandchild. What was this, Grandpa? This, you say as you again heft the glorious weight and swing it whistling through the air and ponder a life not guaranteed, this was my squash racquet. </p><p> The ball the schoolboys originally swatted was a globe of vulcanized India rubber pierced with a hole. At the turn of the twentieth century, it became a gutta-percha ball, then the Hewitt, the black Seamless, the Cragin green diamond, the revolutionary blue Merco seventy-plus, the Slazenger fuchsia ball, and now the black Dunlop Revelation Pro XX Yellow Dot. The ball has always been small and quick, an effulgent moonrock flashing and floating through the white space of the court. It cruises like a nuclear pinball. It ricochets like bees shaken in a jar. It darts like a scared serpent. And then it dies upon command. Like the faddish board game from the 1970s, squash is the Othello of games: It takes a minute to learn but a lifetime to master. </p><p> The walls were originally made of stone quarried from the earth. They did not enclose as much as draw a line across nature. They were open to the clouds, the spitting rain and golden bars of sunlight. Now squash is inside. The court is a cage. You run on a floor made from northern maple ,with the unpainted boards set on edge for speed. Lights dangle from a fluorescent ceiling. The four walls, constructed of gypsum plaster and concrete or high density composite panel, are incapable of causing distraction or prompting reverie. They are niveous and functional. The only interruptions are a few firehouse-red lines and a piebald, carbon smear pockmarking the walls with the signature fingerprint of squash. The walls are Piet Mondrian in an unhappy mood, meant to be played upon. </p><p> Squash saturates the senses. There is the burnt perfume of heated rubber, the tangy admixture of sweat, dust, stale air and wood, the unexpungable odor of ego on display. There is a woolly thirst on the tongue after the most exhausting hour of the day. There is the sight of two people moving so fluidly, in such close proximity and in such a state of ecstasy that it appears they are dancing. There is the Euclidean violence of the dark ball careening from white wall to white wall in combinations only physicists and the gods can explain, and at a speed faster than you can drive a car. </p><p> Sound defines the game. The ball makes a schlooping hiss as it comes off hair-thin strings stretched to thirty pounds per ounce. Sneakers squeak on the floor like a disgruntled aviary. Players grunt and gasp and moan at errors. In between points they wipe their hands along the wall as if they are painting with sweat. Above all there is the distinctive <i>phlap</i> of rubber meeting wood. This is squash -- the ball closing upon itself as it slams into the front wall, then opening again as it rebounds back. It is a stuttering, metronomic incantation, as intimate, steady and comforting as a heartbeat. </p><p> Meshed together in the alchemy of squash, the bat, ball and the wall produces beauty and truth. The Holy Grail of the game is perfect length. You try to propel the ball so it glides along the side wall and dies against the back wall. The walls are your enemies. They push your drives back into the center of the court, spin your cross-courts too sharply, kick out your drop shots, repel your advances. You are helplessly in love. Again and again you come back. You aim and hit, hoping the ball will hug the wall, perhaps gently graze it like a lover brushing her lips against your skin. You hit a slow, whispering shot. You hit an electric, ardent shot. It is all the same. No matter how beautiful your stroke, the truth is that you cannot achieve perfect length. You adopt the mien of a monk. You practice alone. You grow pale from the hours spent under artificial lights. You punish yourself with arm-aching drills. You crack one rail after another. You rake a ball that rushes past the side wall like a locomotive on a downhill run and crashes into the back corner, unplayable, stuck to the wall like wallpaper and say, "good length." But you never say, "perfect length." Such a thing does not exist. </p><p> Good length is a part of the dialogue of squash. You can rehearse for hours, snap off a hundred shots, one after another, videotape a stroke, repetitively groove your swing until your hand twitches in your sleep, but in a match, like in romance, you can only control your half of the flirtation. A match involves two people. As with all the best games, there is no clock, no limit but what you create. To beat an opponent, you might proceed by indirection, as in sailing. You might throw in inspired combinations of tacks when you sense the wind shifting, when your opponent is tiring or becoming exasperated or growing angry. You might proceed by a golflike pattern: long drives followed by chipped wedges, then a short, putting dropshot. You might play basketball and go for a winner from three-point range or dash up for a tomahawk dunk. You might take a technique from crew and try to row through your opponent on the home stretch of the fifth game by exceeding his power output. You might play chess. Squash is a culminative game. You pile up tiny victories, you employ tactics, you hunt for psychological advantages, you retreat with the Sicilian defense. Whatever you do, an opponent answers back. You have to react to him. The conversation is rapid fire, elliptical, maddeningly addictive, improvisational, close to the bone. Unlike tennis, there is no net separating you and your opponent in a squash court. You jostle and bump right up against him. You touch his sweat. You hear his heaving lungs exhaling air. You smell his fear or exultation and, if you are not careful, you might absorb it. Squash is the Stockholm syndrome at a hundred miles per hour. </p><p> If squash is literature, it is poetry. Its lines are short but heavy with meaning. It condenses and concentrates, distills and refines. It exposes your character like an X ray exposes your bones. It is madness in an unpadded cell. The term for the spectator bleachers at a squash court is the gallery, and squash, seen from above, is like an Impressionism art show. It is something aesthetically soft and engrossing on display. The bodies blur. The racquets flash. The seismic thumps of the ball seem attractive. But, down on the ground, it is murder in the court. </p><p> At heart squash is boxing with sticks and a piece of rubber. The same sweet science of pugilism, minus the neutral corners, controls the game. You have a thousand cubic feet of territory to claim. You come out strong. You probe for weaknesses. You jab with boasts and lobs. You circle in a fight for the center of the court. You clinch with the hand-push when caught going the wrong way. You rope-a-dope with attritional drives to the back corners. You swing haymaker volleys into the nick. You tire. You find a second wind. You slump on a stool in between games, sucking on water, toweling off sweat. You go for the knockout drop at match point in the fifth. You shake hands, you hug and you exit together, bound forever by the crucible of the contest. Outside the winter fugue of snowfall and early darkness is playing but, inside, you are as bright and warm as a fire. &lt;...</p></p><h2>The Princess, the Crone, and the Dung-Cart Knight (The Squire&#39;s Tales, 6)</h2><p>Ever since the murder of her mother and guardian, Sarah has been searching for the knight she holds responsible for their death. But vengeance may not be as satisfying as she thought it would be.</p><p>When Gerald Morris was in fifth grade he loved Greek and Norse mythology and before long was retelling the stories to his younger sister and then to neighborhood kids. He began carrying a notebook in which he kept some of the details related to the different stories. The joy he found in retelling those myths continued when he discovered other stories. According to Gerald Morris, &#x201c;I never lost my love of retelling the old stories. When I found Arthurian literature, years later, I knew at once that I wanted to retell those grand tales. So I pulled out my notebook . . . I retell the tales, peopling them with characters that I at least find easier to recognize, and let the magic of the Arthurian tradition go where it will.&#x201d; Gerald Morris lives in Wausau, Wisconsin, with his wife and their three children. In addition to writing he serves as a minister in a church.Grade 6-9-In grand storytelling style, the author continues his series with Sarah, an orphaned teenager who is on a quest for revenge when she encounters Queen Guinevere and Sir Kai. After Kai catches Sarah trying to steal his sword, he gives her a special sword made for his son and teaches her how to use it. When the evil Sir Meliagant kidnaps Guinevere and wounds Kai, Sarah searches for a way to help them. A crone leads her to Camelot where she meets King Arthur, and she goes with Sir Gawain and his squire to rescue Kai and Guinevere. On the road, they encounter trickery, danger, and many characters and plot twists. Sarah gets her revenge, but it is not sweet, and this well-drawn character eventually finds strength and peace within herself. This imaginative novel doesn't take itself too seriously, and yet Morris manages to make some serious points. In the author's note, he is open about taking liberties with Chretien de Troyes's original story The Knight of the Cart, but, after all, there is no one, true Arthurian legend.

Essays by such distinguished writers as Peter D. Kramer, Kay Redfield Jamison, Danielle Ofri, Robert Coles, Lauren Slater, Sandeep Jauhar, and Perri Klass create a vivid mural of the medical world, from a student&#x2019;s uneasy first encounter with a cadaver to a veteran doctor&#x2019;s memories of the emotionally charged days and nights of residency.</p><p>Lee Gutkind is the founder and editor of the literary journal Creative Nonfiction and a pioneer in the field of narrative nonfiction. Gutkind is also the editor of In Fact and Becoming a Doctor, the author of Almost Human, and has written books about baseball, health care, travel, and technology. A Distinguished Writer in Residence at Arizona State University, he lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Tempe, Arizona.In this noteworthy yet somewhat uneven collection, journalist Gutkind assembles a chorus of 19 doctors who voice as many diverse features and phases of being or becoming a doctor. From pediatrician to professor, physician to psychoanalyst, the characteristics of each person&#x2019;s story are at once unique to the medical profession (e.g., the medical student&#x2019;s first encounter with dissection) and universal (e.g., an as-yet-undeclared geriatrician&#x2019;s feelings of helplessness in the face of his grandmother&#x2019;s illness). The authors hail from every corner of the country, and while all can legitimately claim that writing is at least a serious avocation, several are already published and even award-winning writers. Two things are distinctive here. One is that these insights embody a number of generally unvoiced challenges drawn from incidents within the trenches of the medical profession. The other is that the essay format forces pithy, laser-like exposure of self-analytical and thought-provoking perspectives that are certain to engage prospective medical practitioners as well as medically curious lay readers. --Donna Chavez</p><h2>Networks of Rebellion: Explaining Insurgent Cohesion and Collapse (Cornell Studies in Security Affairs)</h2><p><p>Insurgent cohesion is central to explaining patterns of violence, the effectiveness of counterinsurgency, and civil war outcomes. Cohesive insurgent groups produce more effective war-fighting forces and are more credible negotiators; organizational cohesion shapes both the duration of wars and their ultimate resolution. In <i>Networks of Rebellion</i>, Paul Staniland explains why insurgent leaders differ so radically in their ability to build strong organizations and why the cohesion of armed groups changes over time during conflicts. He outlines a new way of thinking about the sources and structure of insurgent groups, distinguishing among integrated, vanguard, parochial, and fragmented groups. </p><p>Staniland compares insurgent groups, their differing social bases, and how the nature of the coalitions and networks within which these armed groups were built has determined their discipline and internal control. He examines insurgent groups in Afghanistan, 1975 to the present day, Kashmir (1988&#x2013;2003), Sri Lanka from the 1970s to the defeat of the Tamil Tigers in 2009, and several communist uprisings in Southeast Asia during the Cold War. The initial organization of an insurgent group depends on the position of its leaders in prewar political networks. These social bases shape what leaders can and cannot do when they build a new insurgent group. Counterinsurgency, insurgent strategy, and international intervention can cause organizational change. During war, insurgent groups are embedded in social ties that determine they how they organize, fight, and negotiate; as these ties shift, organizational structure changes as well.</p></p><p><p>Paul Staniland is Assistant Professor of Political Science and Codirector of the Program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago.</p><p>"<i>Networks of Rebellion</i> is a tour de force, providing a new theory for understanding why rebel groups have different types of internal organization, and why some hold up to the pressures of war while other collapse. The organization of rebellion is critical for understanding both patterns of violence and the ways that wars end.... It is elegantly written, well argued, and thoroughly researched. Staniland has clearly made a significant contribution to our understanding of rebellion. Moreover, this book is among the most policy-relevant works in political science at this juncture. It is not only a must read for scholars, but for practitioners trying to grasp the intricacies of insurgency, multiparty civil wars, and conflict resolution more generally."</p> (Kathleen Gallagher Cunningham <i>H-Diplo/ISSF Roundtable Reviews</i>)<br><br><p>"Paul Staniland is emerging as one of the most creative and influential scholars of political violence. His <i>Networks of Rebellion</i> will cement that reputation.... the book is a model of cogent theorization, inventive but systematic research design, and effective writing. It constitutes a substantial contribution to the scholarship on political violence and a milestone for field-based, comparative research.... Staniland's work is seminal. To understand civil war we need to understand insurgents, and to understand insurgents we need to look at the social foundations of insurgent organizations.... <i>Networks of Rebellion</i> is impressive empirically. The writing is clear and compelling. The book deserves the recognition it has received and is likely to continue to receive."</p> (Scott Strauss <i>Perspectives on Politics</i>)<br><br><p>"With the reported emergence of some 1,000 rebel groups in the spreading Syrian civil war and the stark contrast of those that seem organized and formidable as opposed to transitory, a careful study of insurgents' structures and networks is most timely. Staniland... focuses on whether the groups are 'horizontally' or 'vertically' integrated or relatively isolated across/within locations, collaborators, and subsidiaries.... This book nicely presents a coherent overall typology complete with extenuating circumstances of contextual and political environments within which groups operate."</p> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>"Paul Staniland's <i>Networks of Rebellion: Explaining Insurgent Cohesionand Collapse </i>is an important contribution to the analysis ofterror networks and their motivations.It deals with a varietyof conflicts, many of which Staniland acknowledges as being under-researched, and presents clear, understandable explanations of eachorganization under review.Through detailed case studies, Staniland highlights the subtle differences between the groups, which in other studies might be discussed collectively under particular titles such as religious extremist or maynot be discussed at all if they are smaller or do not pose the largest threat&#x2015;and illustrates how subtle differences can have significant implications."</p> (Patrick Finnegan <i>Parameters</i>)<br><br><p>"Staniland's three case studies serve as comparative evidence to test the author's theory. Additionally, the case studies make valuable contributions to the study of Kashmir, Afghanistan, and Sri Lanka. The author's personal field research supports each of the three case studies, which adds to their overall value and lends support to his argument. Serious students of insurgency, irregular warfare, strategy, international relations, and Southern Asia will value this groundbreaking study. Staniland's work is very much worth reading, especially for those who wish to understand insurgent organizations, particularly insurgent organizations in Kashmir, Afghanistan, and Sri Lanka."</p> (Lt. Col. Jonathan P. Klug <i>Military Review</i>)<br><br><p>"Staniland's project is diligent in its methodological rigour, impressive in its empirical findings, and assertive and compelling in the theory it builds accordingly. Staniland's contribution to insurgency studies is reminiscent to how the field of critical terrorism studies emerged from scholarly dissatisfaction with the pre-existing quality of work in terrorism studies, particularly in terms of its epistemology, ontology, ethics, and praxis. His mission is ambitious, but <i>Networks of Rebellion </i>delivers against it and has laid the foundations of a new research agenda."</p> (Will Carter <i>Small Wars and Insurgencies</i>)</p><h2>Willie&#39;s Boys: The 1948 Birmingham Black Barons, The Last Negro League World Series, and the Making of a Baseball Legend</h2><p><p>The story of Willie Mays's rookie year with the Negro American League's Birmingham Black Barons, the Last Negro World Series, and the making of a baseball legend</p> <p>Baseball Hall of Famer Willie Mays is one of baseball's endearing greats, a tremendously talented and charismatic center fielder who hit 660 career homeruns, collected 3,283 hits, knocked in 1,903 runs, won 12 Gold Glove Awards and appeared in 24 All-Star games. But before Mays was the "Say Hey Kid", he was just a boy. <i>Willie's Boys</i> is the story of his remarkable 1948 rookie season with the Negro American League's Birmingham Black Barons, who took a risk on a raw but gifted 16-year-old and gave him the experience, confidence, and connections to escape Birmingham's segregation, navigate baseball's institutional racism, and sign with the New York Giants. <i>Willie's Boys</i> offers a character-rich narrative of the apprenticeship Mays had at the hands of a diverse group of savvy veterans who taught him the ways of the game and the world. </p><ul> <li>Sheds new light on the virtually unknown beginnings of a baseball great, not available in other books</li> <li>Captures the first incredible steps of a baseball superstar in his first season with the Negro League's Birmingham Black Barons</li> <li>Introduces the veteran group of Negro League players, including Piper Davis, who gave Mays an incredible apprenticeship season</li> <li>Illuminates the Negro League's last days, drawing on in-depth research and interviews with remaining players</li> <li>Explores the heated rivalry between Mays's Black Barons and Buck O'Neil's Kansas City Monarchs , culminating in the last Negro League World Series</li> <li>Breaks new historical ground on what led the New York Giants to acquire Mays, and why he didn't sign with the Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Yankees, or Boston Red Sox</li> </ul> <p>Packed with stories and insights, <i>Willie's Boys</i> takes you inside an important part of baseball history and the development of one of the all-time greats ever to play the game.</p></p><p><p>New York Giants head scout and former pitching ace Carl Hubbell described his visit to the Polo Grounds to watch the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League play the New York Cubans as "the day I saw the best goddamn baseball player I have ever seen in my life." Hubbell sensed that the gangly teenager with blinding speed, a whip-like arm, and dynamite in his bat was more than a raw talent&#x2014;and he was right. The Black Barons' manager and players had made a mission of coaching, grooming, and advising this ferociously capable youngster to take advantage of an opportunity most of them would never have&#x2014;to play in the major leagues. Willie Mays would not disappoint them.</p><p>In Willie's Boys, award-winning baseball writer John Klima sheds new light on the amazing, little-known story of Willie Mays's 1948 rookie season as a professional baseball player. He did not officially join the team until the Fourth of July, so he could finish his sophomore year in high school. In a few short months, Willie, still little more than a child off the field, would be transformed from a phenomenally gifted prodigy into a wily pro whose deep understanding of the game would soon equal his natural ability. He would also learn valuable lessons about how to succeed in the unknown territory of "white folks' ball."</p><p>This quintessentially American tale leads you down the long, dusty road of Negro League baseball, a road that would soon reach its end. Drawing on in-depth research and interviews with surviving players, it illuminates the league's last days, explores the heated rivalry between the Black Barons and Buck O'Neil's Kansas City Monarchs, and introduces such legendary players as Artie Wilson, Bill Greason, Alonzo Perry, and Piper Davis. It also breaks new historical ground on how the New York Giants acquired Mays, and why the Dodgers, Yankees, Indians, Braves, White Sox, and Red Sox missed out.</p><p>Willie Mays is not the real hero of this book. That honor belongs to Piper Davis, the Barons' player-manager. A great star of the Negro Leagues in his own right, Davis knew that age and his fiery temper would keep him out of the majors. It was Davis who made it his goal to ensure that his affable and awesomely talented prot�g� had the skills, knowledge, and visibility he needed to get his shot at the majors and make the most of it.</p><p>Peppered with colorful and amusing anecdotes, such as how Willie acquired the nickname Buck Duck and why the Barons' bus driver earned considerably more money than most of the team's players, Willie's Boys offers a singular and memorable look at a lost era and the making of a baseball legend.</p><b>The baseball legend that might never have been</b><p>"John Klima discovers a terrific story of overcoming all the odds to achieve your dreams.

Wasserman is a prolific writer who has been published in dozens of national magazines including <i>Black Belt, Pennsylvania Game News, Fur-Fish-Game, International Game Warden, </i>and <i>The Alberta Game Warden.</i> He also penned a weekly outdoor newspaper column for 15 years, and hosted his own popular outdoor talk-radio program for eight years.<strong>From International Game Warden Magazine</strong><br>Wasserman's book is a collection of true stories about encounters with dangerous and unpredictable poachers and criminals. For the average reader of game warden literature it is a great addition to his library, and for the outdoor sportsman it is a great book to provide a behind the scenes view of the seedier side of our profession. This book is not an autobiography of the author, but instead, is an unpretentious, straight forward accounting of some events in his career that left him shaking his head, or counting his blessings. I found this book to be very well written, highly entertaining, and thought provoking. I highly recommend it. ----Gerry W. Lister, Editor<br><br><b>From Pennsylvania Game News Magazine</b><br>Join Officer Wasserman as he shares in a most captivating style, some of his most exciting and harrowing experiences as a Pennsylvania Wildlife Conservation Officer. In more than 30 years he has encountered it all, from the most hardened criminals to the most unbelievable encounters with wildlife. ----Robert C. Mitchell, Editor<br><br><b>From The Alberta Game Warden Magazine</b><br>Wasserman is at his best when his stranger-than-fiction stories reveal their own truths. The seediness of many of these characters will make you squirm. --Cheryl Moskaluk, Editor<p><b>From Pennsylvania Magazine</b><br>Wasserman's accounts read like scripts for a true-life reality television show.

Delve into the Word of God to learn what God&#39;s holiness is and what ours is to be. As timely now as when it was written over a century ago, the thirty-one chapters equip and exhort believers to &#34;Be holy, because [God is] holy&#34; (1 Peter 1:16). The Path to Holiness examines both the Old and New Testaments helping believers progress along the path of sanctification and grow in a holy lifestyle before God. Originally titled Holy in Christ, this updated edition includes Andrew Murray&#39;s original applications and prayers.</p><p>Andrew Murray was born in South Africa in 1828. After receiving his education in Scotland and Holland, he returned to South Africa and spent many years there as both a pastor and missionary. He wrote over two hundred books, including some of the most enduring classics of Christian literature. He and his wife, Emma, raised eight children, and it is said that their home was an endless stream of activity.</p><h2>The Art of the Russian Matryoshka</h2><p>The book is the complete account of the history, production, varieties, and creators of the nesting doll that has become a symbol of Russian folk culture, if not Russia itself. Contributing to the history are commissioned studies from three of Russia&#39;s leading authorities on toys and folk art. The book includes 330 color plates, 200 of which are carefully selected examples of dolls. The examples include: historical dolls from museums in Russia; factory products made throughout the Soviet period in the villages of Sergiev Posad, Polkhovsky Maidan, Semyonov, Kirov, and Nolinsk; and artwork of independent artists, photographed in several of the artists&#39; home-studios, in private collections, and in the inventory of importer-author Rett Ertl.</p><p>The Art of the Russian Matryoshka is the definitive account of the wooden nesting dolls, covering their history, how and where they are made, the many variations and different styles of dolls, and their creators. Author Rett Ertl uses his thirty years of experience in Russia to present this information in a straightforward and engaging style, while tying the story of nesting dolls into the story of Russia&#x2019;s development. He concludes that matryoshki are not just dolls within dolls, but themes within themes and symbols within symbols. <p>The first Russian doll was created in 1899. It was turned on a lathe by a master toy maker in Sergiev Posad, home of a well known monastery and several wooden toy workshops. The doll was soon widely produced, becoming the symbol of Russia that it is today. </p><p>The tools and techniques for making matryoshki are essentially unchanged since the time of the first dolls. The book presents each step in the manufacturing process, from the cutting and drying of linden and birch logs, to preparing the wood and turning it on a lathe, to the priming, painting, and lacquering of the dolls. The photos reveal a Russia that most would think had disappeared long ago. </p><p>In classifying and describing the immense variety of kinds, shapes, sizes and styles of dolls, Ertl brings to bear more than ten years as an importer of Russian crafts. He has applied the product and marketing sense of a businessman to survey the full range of these dolls, from toys to souvenirs to works of fine art. </p><p>The chapter on cities and factories describes the "Matryoshka Trail," beginning in Sergiev Posad, which is still a major production center, moving to Polkhovsky Maidan, where matryoshka making is literally a backyard business, and including the large factories in Semyonov, Kirov, and Nolinsk. </p><p>Matryoshka making has blossomed since the fall of the Soviet Union. Artists are now able to create whatever kinds of dolls they wish and to sell them freely. Creating matryoshki has also provided a living to people who have lost the jobs that they held in the planned economy. The chapter on artists gives a brief look into the lives of some of these independent matryoshka artists. </p><p>Ertl draws on his decades of experience to give advice on collecting matryoshki in the final chapter. Dolls shown in this chapter and throughout the book come from Ertl&#x2019;s own shelves, several collectors in the United States, Russian museums, and other importers. Readers are invited to collect matryoshki as an accessible way to participate in a Russian folk art tradition that is tightly tied to the past, yet has evolved to reflect the fascinating changes occurring in Russia today.</p>RETT ERTL <p>Rett Ertl is a career-long Russia hand.

As young women, all three leave their homes. Margie and Theresa go to Duluth for college and work; there Theresa gets to know a handsome Indian boy, Michael Washington, who invites her home to the Sweetgrass land allotment to meet his father, Zho Wash, who lives in the original allotment cabin. When Margie accompanies her, complicated relationships are set into motion, and tensions over &#x201c;real Indian-ness&#x201d; emerge.</p><p>Dale Ann, Margie, and Theresa find themselves pulled back again and again to the Sweetgrass allotment, a silent but ever-present entity in the book; sweetgrass itself is a plant used in the Ojibwe ceremonial odissimaa bag, containing a newborn baby&#x2019;s umbilical cord. In a powerful final chapter, Zho Wash tells the story of the first days of the allotment, when the Wazhushkag, or Muskrat, family became transformed into the Washingtons by the pen of a federal Indian agent. This sense of place and home is both tangible and spiritual, and Linda LeGarde Grover skillfully connects it with the experience of Native women who came of age during the days of the federal termination policy and the struggle for tribal self-determination.</p><p><i>The Road Back to Sweetgrass</i> is a novel that that moves between past and present, the Native and the non-Native, history and myth, and tradition and survival, as the people of Mozhay Point navigate traumatic historical events and federal Indian policies while looking ahead to future generations and the continuation of the Anishinaabe people.<br> &nbsp;</p><br></p><p><p>Linda LeGarde Grover is a member of the Bois Forte band of Ojibwe and&nbsp;associate professor of American Indian studies at the University of Minnesota Duluth. <i>The Road Back to Sweetgrass</i> has been awarded the Native Writers Circle of the Americas First Book Award; Grover has also received the Flannery O&#x2019;Conner Award and the Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize, whose previous recipients include Ann Patchett, Anne Tyler, and Toni Morrison.</p><br>"With the grace of a dancer lifted by spirit and grounded in the well-worn earth beneath her feet, Linda LaGarde Grover tells a circular tale of life on and off the Reservation. Generous, ironic, and often gut-wrenching, <i>The Road Back to Sweetgrass </i>is at its large heart a book about the power of home and the inexorable connections between land, people, and stories." &#x2014;Danielle Sosin, author of <i>The Long-Shining Waters&nbsp;</i><br><br>&nbsp;"History, humanity and humor&#x2014;these things always impress me when I read Linda LeGarde Grover&#x2019;s fiction. In this deeply moving and healing book, we are drawn into a communally told story that shows generations violently separated yet held together by the cord of place and culture and by many, many acts of love." &#x2014;Heid E. Erdrich, author of <i>Original Local</i><br><br>"Through the character of Margie Robineau, Linda LeGarde Grover has created an Ojibwe everywoman who not only births a daughter Crystal, but also revitalizes the small township of Sweetgrass by making family with her would be father-in-law. Grover&#x2019;s novel tackles genealogy and kinship, Indian allotment and traditions, and ultimately love.

While he is remembered for his masterpiece <i>My Past and Thoughts</i> and as the father of Russian socialism, his contributions to the history of ideas defy easy categorization because they are so numerous. Aileen Kelly presents the first fully rounded study of the farsighted genius whom Isaiah Berlin called &#x201c;the forerunner of much twentieth-century thought.&#x201d;</p><p>In an era dominated by ideologies of human progress, Herzen resisted them because they conflicted with his sense of reality, a sense honed by his unusually comprehensive understanding of history, philosophy, and the natural sciences. Following his unconventional decision to study science at university, he came to recognize the implications of early evolutionary theory, not just for the natural world but for human history. In this respect, he was a Darwinian even before Darwin.</p><p>Socialism for Russia, as Herzen conceived it, was not an ideology&#x2015;least of all Marxian &#x201c;scientific socialism&#x201d;&#x2015;but a concrete means of grappling with unique historical circumstances, a way for Russians to combine the best of Western achievements with the possibilities of their own cultural milieu in order to move forward. In the same year that Marx declared communism to be the &#x201c;solution to the riddle of history,&#x201d; Herzen denied that any such solution could exist. History, like nature, was contingent&#x2015;an improvisation both constrained and encouraged by chance.</p></p><p>Aileen Kelly is Fellow of King&#x2019;s College and Reader in Intellectual History and Russian Culture, Emerita, at the University of Cambridge.As Aileen Kelly demonstrates in this absorbing, revelatory and surely definitive study, the intellectual catalyst that shaped Herzen&#x2019;s rejection of the idea that freedom is found in submitting to historical necessity was his encounter with science. Kelly makes a salutary break with the picture of Herzen as a Romantic rebel. (John Gray <i>Literary Review</i>)<br><br>Of Russia&#x2019;s great nineteenth-century writers, two stand out as consistently critical of teleological systems and passionately devoted to a humanism of direct vital feeling: Leo Tolstoy and Alexander Herzen. Aileen Kelly&#x2019;s monumental intellectual biography, with its focus on Herzen the natural scientist refusing to flinch before contingency, transforms the Romanticism of this visionary thinker into something tougher and more robust&#x2015;he was as tolerant of inconsistency as was Darwin and just as shrewdly earthbound. Here is a Herzen for our times and our most urgent debates. (Caryl Emerson, Princeton University)<br><br>This book is brilliantly argued, beautifully written, and profoundly thought-through. This will be one of a handful of classics about Russian thinkers. (Gary Saul Morson, Northwestern University)<br><br>[A] gripping biography of a tragic if courageous life...[The] hidden strands in Herzen&#x2019;s thought, painstakingly uncovered here by Aileen Kelly, provide yet another compelling reason we should read the melancholy old Russian again and recognize, in his anguished attempt to defend human freedom in dark times, amid all the cruelty of history, that he is truly our contemporary. (Michael Ignatieff <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>Magisterial...Kelly offers us a new Herzen to consider&#x2015;not the last of the Romantics, or the radical Russian exile, but the man inspired since boyhood by science and the natural world. Tracing Herzen&#x2019;s thought through this lens, she places Herzen firmly and unexpectedly within a line of thinkers from Francis Bacon to Charles Darwin. (Robin Feuer Miller <i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>Aileen Kelly&#x2019;s new intellectual biography of Herzen demonstrates, for the first time, how the many conflicting assessments of him could all be correct. Her Herzen oscillates between opposing impulses, inclined in turn to romantic utopianism and ironic realism...Kelly has given us not only the best portrait of Herzen, but also a profound contribution to intellectual debate today. (Gary Saul Morson <i>New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>Kelly maintains a fine balance between the events of [Herzen&#x2019;s] life and the intellectual currents that shaped him...She seems to have absorbed everything relevant to her subject, and she challenges received opinion with brio. As I was reading it, I was thinking that anyone interested in the intellectual life of the 19th century would profit from this book, but having finished it, I think anyone interested in intellectual life, period, should get it. It&#x2019;s the best work of history or biography I&#x2019;ve read in a long time. (Stephen Dodson <i>The Millions</i>)<br><br>This is a remarkably thorough intellectual biography that examines almost everything Herzen ever read and provides detailed analysis of his most significant writings. (J. Zimmerman <i>Choice</i>)<br><br>If you read only one book related to Russia this year, this should be it. Kelly&#x2019;s magisterial intellectual biography of Alexander Herzen not only creates a complete image of the remarkable nineteenth-century Russian philosopher and revolutionary but also reveals the roiling intellectual currents that engulfed Russia&#x2019;s intelligentsia during each stage of Herzen&#x2019;s life. In many ways, he was a man of our times as much as his own. The philosophical problems that he struggled with (the essence of freedom, the role of providence in human affairs), his dramatic intellectual evolution, and his final embrace of chance and contingency as the core of his political thought: all have resonance today, when power is often wielded by people who embrace teleological certainties. Kelly masterfully traces the intellectual currents to which Herzen contributed, alongside Montesquieu, Francis Bacon, and dozens of lesser-known eighteenth-century thinkers, and reveals the influence that figures such as Ludwig Feuerbach, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and Saint-Simon had on Herzen. Above all, in elegant detail, Kelly establishes how central science was to Herzen&#x2019;s life and thought. Herzen did more than anyone else&#x2015;certainly more than the social Darwinists or the Leninists&#x2015;to fuse Darwin&#x2019;s insights into a philosophy of history. (Robert Legvold <i>Foreign Affairs</i>)<br><br>Kelly is a superb guide, not only aware but fully conversant with Herzen&#x2019;s explorations of thinkers as diverse as Francis Bacon, Saint-Simon, Hegel, Feuerbach, Marx, Darwin, John Stuart Mill, Proudhon and Bakunin...The book is also a joy to read in terms of its style...Kelly&#x2019;s conception of Herzen is compelling and of lasting value...One comes to the conclusion that <i>The Discovery of Chance</i> is a superlative study of Herzen, deeply researched and well-written, attuned to the different strains in its subject&#x2019;s thinking. (Andr� van Loon <i>Berlin Review of Books</i>)</p><h2>Philosophical Perspectives on Music</h2><p>Designed to introduce music students and musicians to the vitality of music philosophical discourse, <em>Philosophical Perspectives on Music</em> explores diverse accounts of the nature and value of music. It offers an accessible, even-handed consideration of philosophical orientations without advocating any single one, demonstrating that there are a number of ways in which music may reasonably be understood. This unique approach examines the strengths and advantages of each perspective as well as its inevitable shortcomings. <br> From the pre-Socratic Greeks to idealism, through phenomenology, and on to contemporary socio-cultural critiques, this wide-ranging survey examines the views of selected influential thinkers in sufficient detail to permit their voices to be personally and meaningfully experienced. Striving to portray philosophy as an intriguing dialogue rather than a dogmatic source of definitive answers, it invites readers to become full participants in an ongoing process of philosophical debate with vital contemporary relevance and extensive practical significance. Examining what music is, how it works, and what music is good for, this book encourages musicians to join in important conversations that shape both the ways they practice their art and the ways in which they and others understand it. <br> Accessible to students with little or no background in music philosophy, <em>Philosophical Perspectives on Music</em> provides the foundation for applied or professional philosophies while also introducing readers to the richness of the philosophical quest. Ideal for philosophy of music and philosophy of music education courses, it is also enlightening reading for students of musicology, music theory, and music performance. Featuring interdisciplinary dialogue, this insightful text addresses issues common to the concerns of all musicians.<br></p><p>Wayne D. Bowman is at Brandon University, Manitoba.Bowman displays a wide knowledge of the history of philosophy of music and familiarity with several important contemporary perspectives ... it introduces a wide range of positions. Another valuable feature of the book is that each philosopher&#39;s views on music are put in the context of his other beliefs ... Bowman provides accurate accounts of the positions he describes. The book is the product of considerable scholarship. Another plus is that Bowman is surely right to think that students can not appreciate a philosopher&#39;s views on music without some knowledge of his philosophical system ... Bowman is to be commended for undertaking to introduce musicians to philosophy of music. He believes, and is right to believe that unexamined music is not worth performing ... ... sophisticated students can be referred to this volume in some circumstances. James O. Young, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, Winter 1999 (57:1) Bowman&#39;s volume provides a useful survey of philosophical aesthetics of music Andy Hamilton, Durham University, British Jrnl of Aesthetics, vol 39, no 3, 1999 a deeply pluralist book ... Wayne Bowman&#39;s pluralism does not lead him to produce a rootless, or even routeless, book, since he still manages to accept that the philosophy of music has had a history Anthony Pryer, Journal of the Royal Musical Association, 124 (1999) Bowman&#39;s method of treating his material is well considered. The scope of discussion is admirable. About twenty different views of music are given a thorough presentation ... a unique source for anyone interested in the nature of music.

Dividing reviewers with its ambiguous depiction of ghosts, the film ignited a debate about the aesthetics of horror which still rages today.<br><br>In this stimulating introduction to <em>The Innocents</em>, Sir Christopher Frayling traces the film from its genesis in the original novel <em>The Turn of The Screw</em> by Henry James, via contemporary critical contexts and William Archibald's 1950 stage adaptation of the same name, to the screenplay by William Archibald, Truman Capote and John Mortimer. Drawing on unpublished material from Jack Clayton's archive &#x2013; including Capote's handwritten drafts for the film &#x2013; and interviews with Deborah Kerr, Freddie Francis, and John Mortimer, Frayling explores how this classic ghost story came to life on screen. <br><br>This special edition features original cover artwork by Matthew Young.</p><p>Christopher Frayling is Rector of the Royal College of Art in London, and the author of 16 books on design and popular culture.</p><h2>Dutch Graphic Design: 1918-1945</h2><p>This volume traces the graphic design history that took place in the Netherlands between the two World Wars.

And even after one reading there are already musical passages that this Schubert enthusiast finds himself hearing in quite a new way. Bayan Northcott, BBC MUSIC MAGAZINE The old stereotypes of Schubert as Bohemian artist and unselfconscious creator have been replaced over the past half-century with a picture of a difficult man in difficult times. The author aims to redress the balance, concentrating firstly on works where Schubert&#39;s beliefs are clearly expressed (masses, other religious music, songs amounting to Geistliche Lieder). This also prompts an examination of instrumental masterpieces [Unfinished and Great C Major Symphonies, and the Wanderer Fantasy], which show that Schubert&#39;s religious side encompasses awe and terror as well as wonder. Schubert&#39;s &#39;complete voice&#39; is thus clearly heard, rather than the sombre one currently emphasised in both literature and concert. LEO BLACK is a former BBC chief producer for music.</p><p>LEO BLACK is a former BBC chief producer for music.Remarkable new study.

After the fall of the Manchu dynasty in 1912, Xianyu's father gave his daughter to a Japanese friend who was sympathetic to his efforts to reclaim power. This man raised Xianyu, now known as Kawashima Yoshiko, to restore the Manchus to their former glory. Her fearsome dedication to this cause ultimately got her killed.<br><br>Yoshiko had a fiery personality and loved the limelight. She shocked Japanese society by dressing in men's clothes and rose to prominence as Commander Jin, touted in Japan's media as a new Joan of Arc. Boasting a short, handsome haircut and a genuine military uniform, Commander Jin was credited with many daring exploits, among them riding horseback as leader of her own army during the Japanese occupation of China. <br><br>While trying to promote the Manchus, Yoshiko supported the puppet Manchu state established by the Japanese in 1932&#x2015;one reason she was executed for treason after Japan's 1945 defeat.

But in Nigeria's "cash and carry" system, 90 percent of the currency never comes back to a bank after it's issued. What happens when two such radically different economies meet and mingle, as they have for centuries in Atlantic Africa?<br> <br> The answer is a rich diversity of economic practices responsive to both local and global circumstances. In <i>Marginal Gains</i>, Jane I. Guyer explores and explains these often bewildering practices, including trade with coastal capitalism and across indigenous currency zones, and within the modern popular economy. Drawing on a wide range of evidence, Guyer demonstrates that the region shares a coherent, if loosely knit, commercial culture. She shows how that culture actually works in daily practice, addressing both its differing scales of value and the many settings in which it operates, from crisis conditions to ordinary household budgets. The result is a landmark study that reveals not just how popular economic systems work in Africa, but possibly elsewhere in the Third World.</p></p><p><b>Jane I.

The postwar reconstruction period witnessed an intense struggle to determine the new Italy&#39;s political and economic orientation. By virtue of their physical presence, ambitions, and evident strategic interests in Italy, the Americans aspired to play an active part in the internal political contest and ideological debate. Professor Harper&#39;s book explores the American role in Italy from the end of the war until the decisive elections of 1948, setting forth its objectives, contradictions, and fundamental limitations. Concentrating on U.S. aid and the economic policies, Professor Harper skilfully traces the attempts of different parties within the U.S. government to build ties to their respective Italian counterparts to bring about basic changes in the Italian political economy. Those alliances remained largely inchoate as, despite their considerable power, the Americans lacked the intellectual preparation and diplomatic leverage to carry out their designs.</p><p>The postwar reconstruction period witnessed an intense struggle to determine the new Italy&#39;s political and economic orientation.

Both long-out-of-print pamphlets display James's contributions to Marxist and revolutionary theory as he documents and elaborates on the aspects of working-class activity that constitute the revolution in today's world. Fully encapsulating James's thoughts on democracy and workers' emancipation, these essential works represent the principal themes that run through James's life: implacable hostility toward all "condescending saviors" of the working class and an underlying faith in the power of ordinary people to build a new world.</p></p><p><p><b>C.

With the current increase in interest in controlled fusion and the wide� spread use of plasma physics in space research and relativistic as� trophysics, it makes sense for the study of plasmas to become a part of an undergraduate student&#39;s basic experience, along with subjects like thermodynamics or quantum mechanics. Although the primary purpose of this book was to fulfill a need for a text that seniors or juniors can really understand, I hope it can also serve as a painless way for scientists in other fields-solid state or laser physics, for instance� to become acquainted with plasmas. Two guiding principles were followed: Do not leave algebraic steps as an exercise for the reader, and do not let the algebra obscure the physics. The extent to which these opposing aims could be met is largely due to the treatment of a plasma as two interpenetrating fluids. The two-fluid picture is both easier to understand and more accurate than the single-fluid approach, at least for low-density plasma phe� nomena.</p><p></p><h2>Chemistry, Hybrid Edition (with OWLv2, 4 terms (24 months) Printed Access Card)</h2><p>Reflecting Cengage Learning&#39;s commitment to offering flexible teaching solutions and value for students and instructors, this new hybrid version features the instructional presentation found in the printed text while delivering all the end-of chapter exercises online in OWL, the leading online learning system for chemistry.

This fully updated Hybrid Edition of Steven and Susan Zumdahl&#39;s CHEMISTRY 9e brings together the solid pedagogy, easy-to-use media, and interactive exercises that today&#39;s instructors need for their general chemistry course. Rather than focusing on rote memorization, CHEMISTRY uses a thoughtful approach built on problem-solving. For the Ninth Edition, the authors have added a new emphasis on critical systematic problem solving, new critical thinking questions, and new computer-based interactive examples to help students learn how to approach and solve chemical problems--to learn to think like chemists--so that they can apply the process of problem solving to all aspects of their lives. Students are provided with the tools to become critical thinkers: to ask questions, to apply rules and develop models, and to evaluate the outcome. In addition, Steven and Susan Zumdahl crafted ChemWork, an online program included in OWL Online Web Learning to support their approach, much as an instructor would offer support during office hours. ChemWork is just one of many study aids available with CHEMISTRY that supports the hallmarks of the textbook--a strong emphasis on models, real world applications, visual learning, and independent problem solving.</p><p>Steve Zumdahl is the author of market-leading textbooks in introductory chemistry, general chemistry, honors-level chemistry, and high school chemistry.

Take too light an approach, however, and an adolescent becomes disengaged and bored, unwilling to work at therapy or likely to terminate therapy prematurely.<br><br> Therapists need to strike a balance between being respectful and directive. But how do you show understanding for the immediate problems of teens while helping them to become more confident, connected, and fulfilled individuals in the longer term? Bromfield answers this question by offering therapists key insights and helping them to understand that, in the therapeutic context, adolescents as well as their therapists often feel lost and sometimes are unsure as to why they meet and what therapy can achieve. <em>Teens in Therapy</em> is the perfect guidebook to this difficult clinical terrain.<br><br> Drawing on years of clinical experience, Bromfield shows therapists that in order to affect change in their clients, adolescents have to want to change, realize what their problems are and how they contribute to them, and, most important, take ownership of their therapy and their lives. Organized into 18 chapters that explore specific treatment techniques&#x2015;valuing the adolescent, promoting honesty, facilitating self-revelation, spotlighting conflict, speaking the patient&#x2019;s language, avoiding the doldrums, working with parents, and more&#x2015;readers will find an enlightening examination of the problems inherent in adolescent therapy, and come away with effective strategies to foresee, address, and then overcome them.Filled with rich case material, <em>Teens in Therapy</em> focuses on the stories and perspectives of adolescents themselves, arming therapists with a clearer sense of purpose and strategy, and giving them the tools necessary to effectively engage their teenage clients in therapy and help them to assume greater responsibility for their treatments and futures.</p><p>Richard Bromfield, Ph.D., is a psychologist at Harvard Medical School and author of Handle with Care: Understanding Children and Teachers and Playing for Real.

In <i>Regulating Wall Street: The New Architecture of Global Finance</i>, an impressive group of the Stern school&#x2019;s top authorities on finance combine their expertise in capital markets, risk management, banking, and derivatives to assess the strengths and weaknesses of new regulations in response to the recent global financial crisis.</p> <ul> <li>Summarizes key issues that regulatory reform should address</li> <li>Evaluates the key components of regulatory reform</li> <li>Provides analysis of how the reforms will affect financial firms and markets, as well as the real economy</li> </ul> <p>The U.S. Congress is on track to complete the most significant changes in financial regulation since the 1930s. <i>Regulating Wall Street: The New Architecture of Global Finance</i> discusses the impact these news laws will have on the U.S. and global financial architecture.</p></p><p><p>The <i>Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</i> of 2010 is everywhere described as the most ambitious and far-reaching overhaul of financial regulation since the 1930s. The Act was born of the severe financial crisis of 2007&#x2013;2009 and the Great Recession that followed. It attempts to fix parts of the financial architecture that failed in the crisis. The Act is already being denounced by some for not going far enough to curb the risky behavior of financial institutions, and condemned by others for going too far and hampering innovation and efficiency in financial markets. </p><p>Following <i>Restoring Financial Stability: How to Repair a Failed System,</i> a forensic analysis of the financial crisis of 2007&#x2013;2009, forty NYU Stern faculty have produced this in-depth analysis of the Dodd-Frank Act. It provides a comprehensive description of the important parts of the Act and a balanced assessment of its likely success as the new regulatory architecture for the financial system. </p><p>The Dodd-Frank Act, together with other regulatory reforms introduced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Reserve, and other regulators as well as financial sector reforms being put in place in Europe, is going to alter the structure of financial markets in profound ways. The editors argue that the Dodd-Frank Act provides much-needed improvements in financial regulation but falls far short of what could have been achieved. </p><p>Today, it seems that everyone's taking credit for predicting the near collapse of America's financial system that started in 2007. But, rather than looking to the past at what went wrong and who was right, in <i>Regulating Wall Street: The Dodd-Frank Act and the New Architecture of Global Finance</i>, leading academics from New York University's Stern School of Business&#x2014;each a specialist in a relevant discipline&#x2014;turn their attentions to the new legislation to regulate Wall Street in the future, and whether the resulting regulations will promote growth and prevent another near collapse of our financial system, or contribute to its catastrophic failure. </p><p>Edited by Viral Acharya, Thomas Cooley, Matthew Richardson, and Ingo Walter, this book is essential reading for policymakers, business executives, and anyone who can benefit from having a clear, coherent, and rigorous framework for thinking about the future of global finance.</p><p><b>VIRAL V.

He had no home, and he could not support the illegitimate child he had fathered during an impetuous love affair in France. The total sum of his achievements since he had left Cambridge consisted of one slim, anonymously issued volume of <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>. Recognition came slowly, but by age seventy, he was revered as a cultural icon, the Poet Laureate of England, and the most celebrated native of the Lake Country.<br> Based on an intimate knowledge of the poet's manuscripts, on a fresh assessment of contemporary records, and a careful analysis of a wealth of new research, this vividly written volume presents the first serious biography of Wordsworth to appear in over twenty-five years. Stephen Gill, a leading authority on Wordsworth, reveals that, in many ways, this giant of English literature led a heroic life. Despite critical condemnation, numbing blows from the death of friends and family, including three of his own children, and his inability to earn a living as a writer in his early years, his dedication to his art did not waver. Moreover, Gill corrects the image of the older Wordsworth as a stodgy betrayer of his radical youth. While his politics certainly did change, and his poetic power waned from 1799 almost to his death in 1850, Wordsworth single-mindedly shaped his own life in submission to a power of imagination whose importance he never doubted.<br> Offering unparalleled insight into Wordsworth's poetic achievement, Gill illuminates what was most essential to Wordsworth himself: his life as a writer.<br></p><p><br> <strong>Stephen Gill</strong> is Fellow and Tutor of Lincoln College, Oxford University. He is the editor of the Oxford Authors <em>William Wordsworth</em>.<br><br>"In his fine new biography of Wordsworth, Stephen Gill...paints a fresh and moving portrait of the poet....He tells his story in a compact prose that is blessedly free of jargon and rich in detail."--<em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Excellent....This is the kind of biography which any writer would be delighted to inspire, let alone to deserve. Stephen Gill detects the underlying direction and momentum of Wordsworth's life, tracing through the impulses of diurnal reality the permanent being of the man."--<em>The Times</em> (London)<p></p><br>"Gill...is superbly equipped to write the first full-scale biography of the poet in twenty-five years. Since the second volume of Mary Moorman's richly detailed account appeared in 1965, a whole generation of scholars has transformed the study of Wordsworth, and Gill has been at or near the center of this revolution....An indispensable book."--<em>The Bloomsbury Review</em><p></p><br>"[A] solid, intelligent, and highly readable biography....Gill sends us back to the poetry with renewed interest, while enlarging our respect for the poet's rugged commitment to his muse."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Gill does a superb job of interrelating the life and work of this particularly autobiographical poet."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Anna Karenina (Wonders of the World)</h2><p>&#39;All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&#39; Acclaimed by many as the world&#39;s greatest novel, Anna Kerenina provides a vast panorama of contemporary life in Russia and of humanity in general. Anna is a sophisticated woman who abandons her empty existence as a wife and turns to her lover Count Vronsky to fulfil her passionate nature -with tragic consequences.</p><p>Some people say <i>Anna Karenina</i> is the single greatest novel ever written, which makes about as much sense to me as trying to determine the world's greatest color. But there is no doubt that <i>Anna Karenina</i>, generally considered Tolstoy's best book, is definitely one ripping great read. Anna, miserable in her loveless marriage, does the barely thinkable and succumbs to her desires for the dashing Vronsky. I don't want to give away the ending, but I will say that 19th-century Russia doesn't take well to that sort of thing.Count Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) published Anna Karenina in 1877. His other works include The Sebastopol Sketches (1855), War and Peace (1869) and A Confession (1879-82). He also involved himself in the running of peasant schools on his estates and the emancipation of the serfs. His works earned him numerous followers in Russia and abroad.

Moscow's Channel One was attempting mass hypnosis over television, a therapeutic session aimed at reassuring citizens panicked over the ongoing political upheaval&#x2015;and aimed at taking control of their responses to it. Incredibly enough, this last-ditch effort to rally the citizenry was the culmination of decades of official telepathic research, cybernetic simulations, and coded messages undertaken to reinforce ideological conformity. In <i>Homo Sovieticus</i>, the art and media scholar Wladimir Velminski explores these scientific and pseudoscientific efforts at mind control.</p><p>In a fascinating series of anecdotes, Velminski describes such phenomena as the conflation of mental energy and electromagnetism; the investigation of aura fields through the &#x201c;Aurathron&#x201d;; a laboratory that practiced mind control methods on dogs; and attempts to calibrate the thought processes of laborers. &#x201c;Scientific&#x201d; diagrams from the period accompany the text. In all of the experimental methods for implanting thoughts into a brain, Velminski finds political and metaphorical contaminations.

The book demonstrates that the Soviet 'New Man' was missing a crucial limb: the brain.

Stylistically daring, &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RThe Good Soldier&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R is narrated, unreliably, by the na�ve Dowell, through whom Ford provides a level of bitter irony. Dowell&#x2019;s disjointed, stumbling storytelling not only subverts linear temporality to satisfying effect, it also reflects his struggle to accept a world without honor, order, or permanence. Called the best French novel in the English language, &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RThe Good Soldier&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R is both tragic and darkly comic, and it established Ford as an important contributor to the development of literary modernism.&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LSTRONG&amp;&amp;RFrank Kermode&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R has taught at Manchester, London, and Cambridge Universities as well as at Harvard, Yale, and Columbia.

Among his many books the most recent are <i>Shakespeare&#x2019;s Language, Pieces of My Mind,</i> and <i>The Age of Shakespeare.</i><br><b>From Frank Kermode&#x2019;s Introduction to</b> <i><b>The Good Soldier<br><br></b></i><p>Ford liked to appear precise about dates, and, as we shall see, <i>The Good Soldier</i> professes to be so; but the dates given in the narrative are in fact very confused. So are the facts of its writing and publication. It is likely that Ford began the novel in the summer or fall of 1913&#x2014;using houseguests, themselves writers, as amanuenses&#x2014;and worked on it possibly for a whole year. He sent some forty pages of manuscript, the opening pages of the book, to Wyndham Lewis as a contribution to Lewis&#x2019;s new avant-garde periodical <i>BLAST</i>, and this extract appeared in the first issue of the journal, which is dated June 20, 1914 (though the issue may not have been published for some time after that date). There was a plan to serialize the whole book in <i>BLAST</i>, but this had to be given up because the second number of Lewis&#x2019;s journal&#x2014;the only successor to the first&#x2014;was greatly delayed, and in fact did not come out until after the first edition of the whole novel had appeared, in March 1915. </p><p>The main reason for concerning oneself with these calendar details is this: The date August 4 is given great significance in the novel, and the question arises whether Ford picked it by accident or was choosing that date, on which the Great War began, as being particularly doom-laden&#x2014;in which case he must presumably have written in the August 4 references after August 4, 1914. If the references existed earlier we are left to consider a really remarkable coincidence. Ford did attach a solemn importance to that date&#x2014;it marked, for him as for many, the end of a civilization. It may not have seemed to him to matter greatly that in the novel the crowding of important events onto the date August 4 is implausible; indeed, it can be shown, in terms of the story itself, to be impossible. But all this goes to show how important the date was to Ford. </p><p>Common sense, and some scraps of external evidence, suggest that the book was indeed partly written or reworked after August 4, 1914, and that Ford, who had perhaps used the date once by accident, now forced it into the very center of the novel. (The most up-to-date study of this complicated problem is Martin Stannard&#x2019;s essay &#x201c;<i>The Good Soldier</i>: Editorial Problems&#x201d; in Hampson, <i>Ford Madox Ford&#x2019;s Modernity</i>, pp. 137&#x2013;148; see &#x201c;For Further Reading&#x201d;.) </p><p>As we have seen, the problem is not merely bibliographical; the date August 4 affects the entire conduct of Ford&#x2019;s story. He was avowedly a man who cared more for impressions than facts&#x2014;indeed, he liked to call himself an impressionist&#x2014;and the scope and integrity of his narrative mattered more to him than complete factual accuracy in its telling. He was more interested in what he called &#x201c;the affair&#x201d; than in mere story; the narrative must be shaped, constructed, with some larger purpose in mind than the simple and plausible setting forth, one after the other, of the events that constitute it. This might well involve damage to verisimilitude, and that is what happens when August 4 is obsessively repeated as the date of crucial events. A further enemy of easy plausibility is the use of an &#x201c;unreliable narrator,&#x201d; particularly as Dowell, without being a complete fool, seems to have rather extensive limitations as an observer of the action, so that learning about it from him is a chancy business; his occasional fits of sensitivity or perceptiveness add to rather than reduce the confusion of our impressions. </p><p>Anyway, it cannot be said that Ford made any attempt to render the date plausible. He positively brandishes it, forces its improbability on our attention. In the opening page of part II, chapter I, we are told that Maisie Maidan died on August 4, 1904. &#x201c;And then nothing happened until the 4th of August, 1913. There is the curious coincidence of dates, but I do not know whether that is one of those sinister, as if half-jocular and altogether merciless proceedings on the part of a cruel Providence that we call a coincidence.&#x201d; Florence, we are told, had superstitious feelings about the date: August 4 was her birthday. It was also the day in 1899 when she started on her world tour with her uncle and &#x201c;a young man called Jimmy,&#x201d; who became her lover on August 4, 1900; a Mr Bagshawe reports that he saw her emerging from Jimmy&#x2019;s room at five o&#x2019;clock in the morning on that date. &#x201c;She had been born on the 4th of August; she had started to go round the world on the 4th of August; she had become a low fellow&#x2019;s mistress on the 4th of August.&#x201d; Exactly one year later she married Dowell. Bagshawe&#x2019;s intervention, which her relationship with Edward could not have survived, also, rather amazingly, occurred on August 4, and it was followed, that same evening, by Florence&#x2019;s suicide. &#x201c;Mr Bagshawe and the fact that the date was the 4th of August must have been too much for her superstitious mind.&#x201d; </p><p>Is this wanton and needless iteration? Perhaps not. It was part of Ford&#x2019;s ambition to make apparently trivial details resonate in such a way that they suggested not local but large historical disasters. His book about Henry James, <i>Henry James: A Critical Study</i>, written shortly before <i>The Good Soldier</i>, expressly admired the older novelist for his ability to make suggestions of this kind, to induce the reader&#x2019;s mind to pass &#x201c;perpetually backwards and forwards between the apparent aspect of things and the essentials of life.&#x201d; Thus the trivial, almost meaningless, life of rich people passing their time in spas, affecting to suffer from heart conditions, may be made to express &#x201c;what life really is&#x2014;a series of such meaningless episodes beneath the shadow of doom.&#x201d; &#x201c;Some one has said that the death of a mouse from cancer is the whole sack of Rome by the Goths, and I swear to you that the breaking up of our little four-square coterie was such another unthinkable event.&#x201d; He means it was an event that for all its smallness reflected the disasters of the greater world&#x2014;for example, the end of a civilization announced by the declaration of the war that, in the opinion of many, sealed its fate. In some unexpected way&#x2014;as unexpected as the power of a date to draw into its orbit many apparently trivial but truly significant events&#x2014;the miseries of the Ashburnhams and their friends and dependents might, to more acute sensibilities, be intelligible as reflections of an immense historical plot.</p></p><h2>Capitalism: A Short History</h2><p><p><b>A comprehensive and concise history of capitalism from its origins to today</b></p><p>In this authoritative and accessible book, one of the world's most renowned historians provides a concise and comprehensive history of capitalism within a global perspective from its medieval origins to the 2008 financial crisis and beyond. From early commercial capitalism in the Arab world, China, and Europe, to nineteenth- and twentieth-century industrialization, to today&#x2019;s globalized financial capitalism, J�rgen Kocka offers an unmatched account of capitalism, one that weighs its great achievements against its great costs, crises, and failures. Based on intensive research, the book puts the rise of capitalist economies in social, political, and cultural context, and shows how their current problems and foreseeable future are connected to a long history.</p><p>Sweeping in scope, the book describes how capitalist expansion was connected to colonialism; how industrialism brought unprecedented innovation, growth, and prosperity but also increasing inequality; and how managerialism, financialization, and globalization later changed the face of capitalism. The book also addresses the idea of capitalism in the work of thinkers such as Marx, Weber, and Schumpeter, and chronicles how criticism of capitalism is as old as capitalism itself, fed by its persistent contradictions and recurrent emergencies.</p><p>Authoritative and accessible, <i>Capitalism</i> is an enlightening account of a force that has shaped the modern world like few others.</p></p><p><p>"The dramatic collapse of state socialism, the revolutionary advance of once-stagnant economies, and, yes, recent financial crisis have all conspired to make capitalism an urgent topic of contemporary research.

Published in France in 1958, the same year the Algerian War brought about the collapse of the Fourth French Republic, it is one of Camus&#x2019; most political works&#x2014;an exploration of his commitments to Algeria.

An appendix of lesser-known texts that did not appear in the French edition complements the picture of a moralist who posed questions about violence and counter-violence, national identity, terrorism, and justice that continue to illuminate our contemporary world.</p></p><p>Albert Camus (1913-1960), Algerian-French novelist, essayist, and playwright, won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957.<p>It was the last book <b>Camus</b> published in his lifetime, and it appears now in its entirety for the first time in English, expertly translated by Arthur Goldhammer. The editor, Alice Kaplan, has added six texts to Camus's original selection in an appendix, to further illuminate Camus's relation to Algeria... As the writings in <i>Algerian Chronicles</i></p><p><br> make clear, Camus's position in 'no man's land' left him increasingly isolated: hated</p><p><br> by the right for his condemnation of government policies, scorned by the left for his inability to imagine an independent Algeria from which the French would be absent...As Kaplan points out, we cannot know how he would have reacted to the final years of the war, or to the independence that followed.

It was to be <b>Camus</b>'s final book and appears in retrospect as a summing-up of his feelings about his birthplace...These remarkably mature dispatches, written when he was 25, show that Camus was anxious from the start about the political relationship between his native country and the mainland...The impetus behind the repeated pleas for constructive dialogue that occupy the later parts of <i>Algerian Chronicles</i> was personal as much as political...<i>Algerian Chronicles</i>, never before translated in its entirety, is a document worth having. (James Campbell <i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2013-05-03)<br><br>[A] brilliant translation...<b>Camus</b> fell silent after this effort, but for one exception. In 1958, while the &#x2018;sale guerre&#x2019; in his native country grew ever more dirty, he returned to his first trade, journalism. Gathering his newspaper articles and commentaries on Algeria, he published them under the title <i>Actuelles III</i>. In his preface, he lambasts France&#x2019;s colonial policy, castigates the use of torture and terrorism by both sides, and defends innocent French and Arabs at the mercy of these violent designs. Yet, he concludes, his book &#x2018;is among other things a history of a failure.&#x2019; But noble failures like the <i>Algerian Chronicles</i> are both timeless and timely. (Robert Zaretsky <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2013-10-11)<br><br><b>Camus</b> was a far more engaged writer than his critics have allowed, and the essays, columns and speeches collected here make a strong case for his continued relevance...Today, although his failure to support full independence for Algeria seems off the mark, Camus stands as a powerful voice against violence and extremism, and the very late appearance of these essays in English could not have come at a better time...With the future of the Arab spring uncertain and with terrorism back on the front page, these <i>Algerian Chronicles </i>are not only history. They're also guides for how to be just in a difficult world. (Jason Farago <i>NPR Books</i> 2013-05-13)<br><br><i>Algerian Chronicles</i>...comprises everything <b>Camus</b> wrote on Algeria...Camus's writing on Kabylia is a marvel of eloquence. His sympathy for the people, his critique of the colonial regime, his pain over the injustices that he witnesses--all thrilling. Seventy years after he wrote these pieces the reader is still penetrated by their literary beauty. But at no time in <i>Algerian Chronicles</i> are we listening to the speaking voice of a revolutionary. It is the voice of a despairing citizen who does not want his country's government overthrown; he wants it to do better by its people. He wants France to remain in Algeria, but to honor its own founding myths of liberty, equality, and fraternity. The pieces in <i>Algerian Chronicles</i> that were written years later in France, during the war for independence, are repetitive pleas for each side to stop demonizing the other, for human decency to prevail.<br> (Vivian Gornick <i>Boston Review</i> 2013-07-01)<br><br>The singular importance of <i>Algerian Chronicles</i> is that it brings together for the first time in English all of <b>Camus</b>'s writings on Algeria, ranging over his early journalism covering the famine in Kabyle in 1939 to his appeals for reason and justice in Algeria in 1958. Beautifully translated by Arthur Goldhammer, they reveal Camus not so much as a philosopher (or 'ponderous metaphysician' as Said called him) but as something like a French George Orwell. Certainly, in all these essays he demonstrates a most un-Parisian aversion to abstraction and a taste for the concrete detail that reveals the reality of a situation...There is a new generation of readers in Algeria who are beginning to understand how [Camus] felt: torn between opposing forms of terror, neither of which promised justice or redemption. <i>Algerian Chronicles</i> is a beautiful and significant illustration of the complexities of that dilemma. (Andrew Hussey <i>Literary Review</i> 2013-05-01)<br><br>[<i>Algerian Chronicles</i>]<b> </b>has not, for the most part, been regarded as one of <b>Camus</b>'s 'important' works...This is, perhaps, an oversight. At a historical moment when it seems crucial to the human prospect to think intelligently about terrorism and other forms of political violence, the thinking Camus does in <i>Algerian Chronicles</i> may strike us, if we open ourselves to it, as necessary, cogent, and sane...What is clear from <i>Algerian Chronicles<b> </b></i>is that Camus's compassion could be triggered by the suffering of any human being, and that his political and moral concern was with any innocent person who might be made the victim of violence in the name of any political cause...<i>Algerian Chronicles<b> </b></i>may have suffered the fate of being published at a time when those who most needed to hear what it had to say were entirely unable to read it with an open mind. It is possible that, now that some decades have passed, it will find a second life. We Americans would be well advised to pay it serious attention. After more than a decade in which the United States has chosen to respond to the specter of lawless terrorism with forms of violence some have regarded as state-sanctioned terrorism--years during which, as in the Algerian war, the violence inflicted by each side has been used to justify the violence inflicted by the other, and during which the use of torture by American military and security forces has been not only condoned but applauded by a large segment of the American citizenry--Camus's reflections on these subjects seem to address us directly. (Troy Jollimore <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Review</i> 2013-06-13)<br><br><i>Algerian Chronicles...</i>has been invisibly translated by Arthur Goldhammer and prefaced perceptively by Alice Kaplan...All [the essays] are a model of engaged journalism: scrupulous and exhaustive in the facts, telling in colorful anecdote, reasoned in argument, with no hint of sarcasm or anger. Apart from their historical interest, <b>Camus</b>'s essays show us two things. One is it is possible to be politically engaged without foaming at the mouth. The other is the more things change in what historian Ian Morris calls 'the arc of instability,' from central Africa to Pakistan, the more they stay the same. Further, they remind us that a great deal of the horror going on there today is the legacy of 19th-century European colonialism and superpower maneuvering in the Cold War...Through all these bloody convulsions and those of the wider region, Camus's central call--to spare the lives of noncombatants--echoes still...After Iraq, after Syria, after the still unexplained suspension of international law in deadly American drone strikes, after the constant bombing of marketplaces and mosques now that asymmetrical war has made obsolete the Geneva Conventions, Camus's voice seems naively idealistic. The world needs that kind of naivete more than ever. (Miriam Cosic <i>The Australian</i> 2013-06-08)<br><br>Despite his lucidity and his avowed anti-colonialism, <b>Camus</b> during his lifetime failed to accept that Algeria should or could be permanently separated from France; and, as Kaplan rightly points out, his premature death in 1960 means that we can never know how he would have reacted to the agreements enacting that separation...At the same time, as a record of passionate insights into the processes involved, the book still makes absorbing reading, not least because of the many portentous analogies between what happened in Algeria and what is happening in much of our world today...<i> Algerian Chronicles </i>is infused with bitter-sweet nostalgia for a personal lost paradise, a not infrequent ingredient of Camus's writing generally. But the book transmits a wider angry grief in its demonstration that the most humane and reasoned ideals seldom work to diminish the destructive and self-mutilating brutalities that humanity, endlessly, inflicts on itself. Camus has been well served here by Arthur Goldhammer, who is probably the most gifted living translator into English of French texts. Goldhammer, in his translator's note, describes the challenges of capturing the purity, restraint, and discipline of Camus's prose; and he expresses the hope that his work has done justice to what he calls 'a precious document of a soul's torment lived in real rather than eternal time.' He need not have worried: the author's voice resounds with eerie clarity. (Colin Nettlebeck <i>Australian Book Review</i> 2013-05-01)<br><br>History has proven <b>Camus</b> right when he warned in 1955 that those who support terror and call for massacres, &#x2018;no matter which camp they come from and no matter what argument or folly drives them, are in fact calling for their own destruction.&#x2019; A lesson the world, alas, has still not learned.

The entire spectrum of the hospitality industry is discussed, including restaurants, hotels, clubs, theme parks, travel, and tourism. <b> </b> For hospitality managers, restaurant managers, club managers, theme park managers, and travel and tourism managers that want a step-by-step guide to providing quality customer service. </p></p><p><p> <i>Quality Service, What Every Hospitality Manager Needs to Know</i> is a genuine hospitality manager's guide to successful customer service. In an easy-to-read style, it tells you everything you need to know about transforming everyday humdrum hospitality into a level of customer service that others will rave about. </p> <p> This book addresses the needs of the entire spectrum of hospitality including foodservice and lodging operations, clubs, theme parks and the entire travel and tourism industry. It provides a simple step-by-step approach to creating and maintaining a hospitality organization where quality service thrives. </p> <p> Its thirty-two application exercises and numerous examples in every chapter make its contents easily adaptable to the specific needs of any hospitality organization. </p> <p> It clearly explains what quality service is and how to provide it, including: </p> <ul> <li>How to create a supportive quality service culture and leadership climate</li> <li> How to weave quality service into your everyday operation</li> <li>How to measure and reward quality service successes</li> <li>How to maintain continuous quality throughout your organization</li> </ul><p> This is the third iteration of what was previously entitled Quality Service, The Restaurant Managers' Bible. When the book first came out in 1986, a surprising thing happened. Most of the feedback and calls I received expressing interest in the book did not come from the restaurant sector. They came from hotel and travel companies. Even then, it was evident to readers that what I had to say about quality service and how to manage it was applicable to a wide audience in the hospitality industry. </p><p> Well, finally in this new millennium, I have written a more comprehensive and broader application to managing quality customer service. This is a different book from earlier editions. It is not only bigger and better, but it also applies to the entire spectrum of hospitality, including, but certainly not limited to, restaurants, hotels, clubs, theme parks, and the entire travel and tourism industry. I have attempted to include as many examples from the various sectors of the industry as possible. </p><p> Delivery of quality customer service remains as important to the success of the hospitality industry as ever. However, that doesn't mean we have been doing a very good job at it. Over the last fifteen years, I have seen some customer service progress in our industry, but it has been slow in coming and spotty in impact. Unfortunately, the fact remains, as an industry, we are doing a very good job delivering a very mediocre customer service product. When it comes to customer service, mediocrity does indeed abound. Of course, there are horror stories that come to light from time to time, and sometimes, albeit far too rarely, hospitality. customers receive a level of service that they can actually rave about. But overall, much customer service progress needs to occur before we can claim, as an industry, that we do in fact deliver a quality customer service product. </p><p> Clearly, more people need to read and implement the contents of this book. </p><p> Improvement in the day-to-day delivery of hospitality customer service will not come without first committing to the concepts presented in this book and then putting them to actual use. With this in mind, I have constructed a complete set of application interaction exercises that accompany each chapter. The thirty-two exercises are designed to facilitate not only a more thorough knowledge and understanding of the concepts presented irk the chapters, but they also serve as a guide for direct hands-on application in any hospitality setting. </p><p> The lasting legacy of customer service in our industry lies in the hands of current and future leaders. For this reason, I have written this book with two audiences in mind: present industry leaders and prospective ones. That is why the book is adaptable for industry use and implementation, as well as for a college-level course in service management. The first three chapters review the fifteen components of customer expectations for hospitality quality service. The framework of these components provides a useful tool for observing, analyzing, and critiquing actual customer service encounters in an ongoing hospitality organization. Chapters 4 through 8 provide a framework by which the management of an entire hospitality organization or a targeted service unit can also be studied and analyzed. Thus, the entire book has been designed to facilitate a comprehensive customer service review of any hospitality operation from a workplace point of view or an academic perspective. </p><p> William B.

By presenting unifying concepts and methods of analysis, this book helps its readers learn to think like biologists and gives them the tools they need for success in understanding more advanced subjects. A nine-part organization covers topics under the general headings of: the origin and early evolution of life, cell functions, gene structure and expression, developmental biology, evolutionary patterns and processes, the diversification of life, how plants work, how animals work, and ecology. For science enthusiasts who want to be inspired with a sense of wonder and excitement that makes learning about biology interesting and fun.</p><p><p> <b><i>Scott Freeman</i></b> received his Ph.D. in Zoology from the University of Washington and was nominated for an Excellence in Teaching Award in 1989. He was subsequently awarded an Albert Sloan Postdoctoral Fellowship in Molecular Evolution at Princeton University to investigate how generation time affects the rate of molecular evolution. Dr. Freeman's research publications explore a range of topics from the behavioral ecology of nest parasitism to the molecular systematics of the blackbird family. As an affiliate faculty member at the University of Washington, he has taught courses in evolution and has played an active role in the redesign of the general biology course. He is currently teaching the majors general biology course using an inquiry-based approach that emphasizes the logic of experimental design and the mastery of core concepts required for success in upper-level courses. Dr. Freeman is the co-author of <i>Evolutionary Analysis,</i> which presents evolutionary principles in the same spirit of inquiry that drives research. </p><p> Faculty who teach introductory biology may have the most exciting and difficult job on campus. The excitement springs from the breathtaking pace of advances in the biological sciences and the wide array of training and career options that are now open to prospective majors; the difficulty lies in introducing students to an already imposing and rapidly increasing number of facts and concepts. </p> <p> When I took introductory biology as an undergraduate in 1975, faculty members were coping with the information explosion by extending the length of their introductory courses and using ever-larger textbooks. Today we don't have those options. Course length is capped at one year and most texts already run in excess of 1100 pages. Over the past decade in particular, presenting a fact-based, synoptic overview of what we know about biology has become increasingly untenable. </p> <p> In short, the information explosion has changed our jobs. Instead of asking students to focus primarily on memorizing facts, more and more instructors are focusing their course on teaching students how to think like a biologist. </p> <p><b>Why a New Introductory Textbook?</b></p> <p> I wrote <i>Biological Science</i> to support professors who want their students to experience a more inquiry-driven approach in introductory biology. My goal was to write a book infused with the questions and the enthusiasm for learning that drive biological research. To help students understand how biologists think, each chapter is built around a series of questions that are fundamental to the topic being addressed. While exploring each question, the presentation incorporates data for students to interpret, offers evidence for competing hypotheses, introduces contemporary researchers, refers to work in progress, and highlights what researchers don't yet know. My aim was to help you teach biology the way you do biology&#x2014;by asking questions and analyzing data to find answers. </p> <p> At the same time, I made a strong commitment to covering the basics. We teach students who want to become doctors, researchers, science journalists, teachers, and conservationists. We have an obligation to prepare them for success in upper division courses, MCATs, and GREs, and to introduce the canon of facts and concepts that they must master to major in biology. Instead of listing these facts and concepts in an encyclopedic manner, however, <i>Biological Science</i> introduces them in the context of answering a question. In this textbook, facts become tools for understanding&#x2014;not ends in themselves. </p> <p> In addition to finding an appropriate balance between covering facts and exploring the scientific process, the level of the presentation is crafted to be appropriate for introductory Students. Sections and sub-sections in the text begin with an overview of what question is being asked and end with commentary that helps students pull the material together. Instead of getting lost in the details of how an experiment was done, the text emphasizes why it was done and what the data mean. Because beginning students are concerned about themselves and their world, most chapters explore how the topic relates to human welfare and all chapters end with an essay inspired by medical, commercial, or environmental concerns. </p> <p><b>The Forest and the Trees: Helping Students to Synthesize and Unify</b></p> <p> In addition to coping with an enormous amount of content in this course, instructors have to manage its diversity. In <i>Biological Science,</i> the emphasis on inquiry and experimentation provides ,a unifying theme from biochemistry through ecosystem ecology. In addition, the text highlights the fundamental how and why questions of biology. How does this event or process occur at the molecular level? In an evolutionary context, why does it exist? </p> <p> The majority of chapters include at least one case history of an analysis done at the molecular level. Natural selection is introduced by exploring the evolution of antibiotic resistance via point mutations in. the RNA polymerase gene of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</i> In the diversity unit, students learn about extracellular digestion in fungi by exploring experiments on the regulation of cellulase genes. A section of the behavior chapter features research on a gene involved in fruit fly foraging behavior. These are just three of many examples. </p> <p> Similarly, evolutionary analyses do not begin and end with the evolution unit. Concepts like adaptation, homology, natural selection, and tree thinking are found in virtually every chapter. Unit 1, for example, presents traditional content in biochemistry&#x2014;ranging from covalent bonding to the structure and function of macromolecules&#x2014;in the context of chemical evolution and the origin of life. Meiosis is analyzed in terms of its consequences for generating genetic variation and making natural selection possible. Shared mechanisms of DNA repair and pattern formation are explained in the context of gene homologies. The overriding idea is that molecular and evolutionary analyses can help unify introductory biology courses, just as molecular tools and evolutionary questions are helping to unify many formerly disparate research fields within biology. </p> <p><b>Supporting Visual Learners</b></p> <p> Clear, attractive, and extensive graphics are critical to our success in the classroom. To emphasize the importance of analyzing figures in biology and to support students who learn particularly well visually, the book's art program is both extensive and closely interwoven with the manuscript. Each figure originated with rough sketches that I made while working on the first draft manuscript, which Dr. Kim Quillin then revised to increase clarity and improve appearance. </p> <p> Throughout this process, our intent was to build an 4rt program that is easy to read and that supports the book's focus on thinking like a biologist. A quick glance through the book should convince you that the art is as distinctive as the text. Color is used judiciously to highlight the main teaching points. Layouts flow from top to bottom and left to right, and extensive labeling lets students work through each figure in a step-by-step manner. Questions and exercises in the captions challenge students to actively interpret the graphics. The overall look and feel of the art is clean, clear, and inviting. </p> <p><b>Serving a Community of Teachers</b></p> <p> By de-emphasizing the encyclopedic approach to learning biology and focusing more on the questions and experimental tools that make biology come alive, our hope was to offer a book that is more readable and attractive to students and teachers alike. Embarking on an introductory course that launches a career in biology should be exciting, not anxiety-ridden. Learning concepts well enough to apply them to new examples and datasets may be more challenging for some students than memorizing facts, but it is also more compelling. By motivating the presentation with questions, and then using facts as tools to find answers, students of biology may come to think and feel more like the people who actually do biology. </p> <p> I've always viewed working on this project as a gift, because it was a chance to serve the community of bright, enthusiastic, and dedicated people who teach this course. Thank you for your devotion to biology, for your commitment to your students, and for considering <i>Biological Science.</i> Teachers change lives. </p> <p><b>For Students</b></p> <p> It's difficult to imagine a more exciting time to launch a career related to biology. The advent of whole-genome sequencing and a rising interest in conservation biology are giving new momentum to a knowledge explosion that began several decades ago. From biochemistry, cell biology, and genetics to physiology, ecology, and evolution, the pace of discovery in the biological sciences is nothing short of astonishing. Your instructors are introducing you to what may currently be the most dynamic of all human endeavors. </p> <p> Delving into biology through this introductory course should help you further two important goals. The first involves personal growth. The topics you'll be learning about pervade your life. Biology is about the food you eat and the air you breathe. It's about the history of life on Earth and the organisms that share the planet with us now. You'll be learning why we get sick, how we reproduce, how plants make food from sunlight. Biology is so basic that understanding it is a fundamental part of becoming an educated person. Taking this course can open your eyes, help you see and think about life in a new way, and fuel a lifelong curiosity about the natural world. </p> <p> The second goal of a course like this involves a potential career path. By preparing you for more advanced classes and a major in the biological sciences, this introductory course will be a crucial first step in acquiring the background you'll need to enter a biology-related profession and help solve pressing problems in health, conservation, or agriculture. Many of the great challenges facing us today&#x2014;from climate change and species extinctions to antibiotic resistance and emerging viruses&#x2014;demand expertise in biology. </p> <p> The purpose of this text is to help you make that important first step toward majoring in the biological sciences andtpursuing a career related to biology. Its goal is not only to be a valuable reference for the fundamentals but also to introduce you to the excitement that drives this science. The presentation focuses on the questions that biologists ask about the natural world and how they go about answering them. Its objective is to introduce the core ideas that biologists use to make sense of the massive amount of information emerging from laboratories around the world. </p> <p> The overall theme in this text is to help you learn how to think like a biologist. No matter what path your career takes, it is virtually certain that you will need to evaluate new hypotheses, analyze new types of data, and draw conclusions that change the direction of your work almost daily.

The region&#x2019;s transition from Democratic stronghold to Republican base has frequently been viewed as a recent occurrence, one that largely stems from a 1960s-era backlash against left-leaning social movements. But as Joseph Lowndes argues in this book, this rightward shift was not necessarily a natural response by alienated whites, but rather the result of the long-term development of an alliance between Southern segregationists and Northern conservatives, two groups who initially shared little beyond opposition to specific New Deal imperatives.</p><p>Lowndes focuses his narrative on the formative period between the end of the Second World War and the Nixon years. By looking at the 1948 Dixiecrat Revolt, the presidential campaigns of George Wallace, and popular representations of the region, he shows the many ways in which the South changed during these decades. Lowndes traces how a new alliance began to emerge by further examining the pages of the <i>National Review</i> and Republican party-building efforts in the South during the campaigns of Eisenhower, Goldwater, and Nixon. The unique characteristics of American conservatism were forged in the crucible of race relations in the South, he argues, and his analysis of party-building efforts, national institutions, and the innovations of particular political actors provides a keen look into the ideology of modern conservatism and the Republican Party.</p></p><p><p>Joseph E.

"'Some things you feel, and can't see; some things you see, and no one believes you,' she liked to say." She takes them into the woods near her home, and there they examine stones and reflect on their origins; learn about some of the treasures in the woman's medicine tool sack; greet a ponderosa pine, hug it, smell its "center"; find out what butterflies symbolize; and lie down on a large boulder together holding hands and become one with it. Through these experiences and Grandma Ann's explanations, Dustin and Rosie begin to understand what she means by the Great Mystery. Describing one's spiritual "way" without straying off into vagueness or sentimentality isn't easy, but Stroud succeeds. Her words are forthright and evoke a childlike eagerness to discover the wonders of nature; this woodland walk is almost like a trip to fairyland. (Indeed, Grandma Ann calls her place Fairy Ranch.) The paintings, rendered in acrylic and gouache paints and ink, are rich in vibrant greens, turquoise, and wildflower tones. The stylized people are doll-like, rosy cheeked, and have black dots for eyes?no noses or mouths. Although the story is quiet and the revelations are subtle, the book is infused with a spirit of adventure as well as with reverence for the Earth.?Vanessa Elder, School Library Journal<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this eco-consciousness-raiser, Dustin and Rosie set out with Grandma Ann to solve a "great mystery." Under the Cherokee medicine woman's tutelage, they study a sacred spiral carved naturally in a stone, sniff the essence of a tree ("It smells just like vanilla!") and stand motionless before a hovering hummingbird. As the three proceed with respect, nature's artifacts and its living things offer up glimpses into the mystery-the spirit "where all of life's powers come from." Some may think Grandma Ann's techniques odd-hugging trees (really), becoming one with a boulder-as Stroud (Doesn't Fall Off His Horse) gently but firmly focuses on the awe-inspiring power of nature. In her glowing acrylic and gouache paintings, the blues, teals and purples of the characters' clothing both contrast and handsomely blend with the luxuriant greens and browns of the woods. Except for round fuchsia spots that indicate cheekbones, the faces here are essentially featureless-a stylized rendering that reflects the individuality of Stroud's vision.

But millions of otherwise successful adults are afraid to balance their checkbooks and don't know how to figure interest on savings or credit. Millions of students dread their math classes and live in fear of the math section of the SAT. But, as Scott Flansburg demonstrates, anyone can put these phobias to rest and deal with essential everyday mathematical calculations with confidence. In <i>Math Magic,</i>Scott Flansburg shows the reader:</p><p></p><ul><li> How to master the basics; <p></p></li><li> How addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division really work; <p></p></li><li> How to simplify calculations through estimation; <p></p></li><li> How to quick-check your answers; <p></p></li><li> How measurements work and how to quickly convert metric measures to more familiar ones; <p></p></li><li> How to figure tips and taxes and be sure you're getting the right change; <p></p></li><li> How to figure percentages; and <p></p></li><li> How to master algebra using the nine easy steps to algebra.</li></ul><p> <i>Math Magic</i> is for all of us who need and want to improve our understanding of math. Flansburg makes math what you may never have imagined it to be: easy and fun.</p></p><p><p>Scott Flansburg is the author of the bestselling book <i>Math Magic</i>. His lectures and his video, <i>Turn on the Human Calculator in You</i>, have helped countless children and adults learn the power of math. He lives in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>Flansburg, "the human calculator" and author of the popular video, Turn on the Human Calculator in You , seeks to improve math education by introducing tricks for performing accurate mental calculations and fun alternate approaches to common math class difficulties. Students are motivated to learn by the chance to show off by quickly solving difficult-looking math problems. Included are ways to simplify problems, tricks for special instances, and explanations of common numerical systems like measurements, calendars, time zones, and prices. One disappointment is that no explanation is offered for some of the most interesting calculation tricks work. Still, in the hands of an enthusiastic teacher, many of these ideas could add excitement to math class. This is a school-oriented pre-algebra course with a little consumer math thrown in. A crash course in algebra is included near the end.<br><i>- Amy Brunvand, Fort Lewis Coll., Durango, Col.</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Postcolonial Middle Ages (The New Middle Ages)</h2><p>An increased awareness of the importance of minority and subjugated voices to the histories and narratives which have previously excluded them has led to a wide-spread interest in the effects of colonization and displacement.

Only by removing Indian children from their homes for extended periods of time, policymakers reasoned, could white "civilization" take root while childhood memories of "savagism" gradually faded to the point of extinction. In the words of one official: "Kill the Indian and save the man."<br><i>Education for Extinction</i> offers the first comprehensive account of this dispiriting effort. Much more than a study of federal Indian policy, this book vividly details the day-to-day experiences of Indian youth living in a "total institution" designed to reconstruct them both psychologically and culturally. The assault on identity came in many forms: the shearing off of braids, the assignment of new names, uniformed drill routines, humiliating punishments, relentless attacks on native religious beliefs, patriotic indoctrinations, suppression of tribal languages, Victorian gender rituals, football contests, and industrial training.<br>Especially poignant is Adams's description of the ways in which students resisted or accommodated themselves to forced assimilation. Many converted to varying degrees, but others plotted escapes, committed arson, and devised ingenious strategies of passive resistance. Adams also argues that many of those who seemingly cooperated with the system were more than passive players in this drama, that the response of accommodation was not synonymous with cultural surrender. This is especially apparent in his analysis of students who returned to the reservation. He reveals the various ways in which graduates struggled to make sense of their lives and selectively drew upon their school experience in negotiating personal and tribal survival in a world increasingly dominated by white men.<br>The discussion comes full circle when Adams reviews the government's gradual retreat from the assimilationist vision. Partly because of persistent student resistance, but also partly because of a complex and sometimes contradictory set of progressive, humanitarian, and racist motivations, policymakers did eventually come to view boarding schools less enthusiastically.<br>Based upon extensive use of government archives, Indian and teacher autobiographies, and school newspapers, Adams's moving account is essential reading for scholars and general readers alike interested in Western history, Native American studies, American race relations, education history, and multiculturalism.<br></p><p>"Education for Extinction delivers on the promise of its title. This is a thorough and thoughtful study of the federal government's Indian education program that was explicitly aimed at extinguishing a culture. That it failed testifies to a deficient understanding of cultural dynamics as well as to the durability of Indian culture. An important contribution to the literature of Indian-white relations."--Robert M. Utley, author of <i>The Lance and the Shield: The Life and Times of Sitting Bull</i> <p>"Adams has achieved something remarkable here: he offers a great deal of information on an important and difficult historical topic while never losing sight of its human dimension. Persuasive and moving, his book is full of good stories that should appeal to the general public."--Brian Dippie, author of <i>The Vanishing American: White Attitudes and U.S. Indian Policy</i> </p><p>"An outstanding contribution to the field of Indian history and the history of Indian education."--Robert Trennert, author of <i>The Phoenix Indian School: Forced Assimilation in Arizona, 1891-1988</i></p>David Adams is associate professor of education at Cleveland State University and the author of chapters in Leonard Dinnerstein and Kenneth Jackson's <i>American Vistas: 1877 to the Present</i> and Philip Weeks's <i>Native American Experience</i>.</p><h2>Antony and Cleopatra (The Pelican Shakespeare)</h2><p><b>The acclaimed Pelican Shakespeare series edited by A.

The subject is truly inter� disciplinary, commands the attention of Earth scientists, is of consider� able interest to fluid dynamicists and civil engineers, and it finds widespread practical applications in industry. Sedimentology may be approached from two viewpoints: a descrip� tive approach, as exemplified by traditional petrography and facies analysis, and a quantitative approach through the physical and chemical sciences. Both approaches are complementary and must be used in tandem if the recent remarkable progress in the field is to be sustained. This text aims to introduce such a combined approach to senior undergraduate students, graduate students and to interested professional Earth scientists. Thus the many descriptive diagrams in the text are counterbalanced by the use of basic physical and chemical reasoning through equations. I have tried to construct a text that follows logically on from the origin of sediment grains through fluid flow, transport, deposition and diagenesis (the change from sediment to rock). The text has been written assuming that some basic previous instruction has been given in the Earth sciences and in general physics and chemistry. Certain important derivations are given in appendices. I have avoided advanced mathematical treatment since it is my opinion that recogni� tion of the basic physical or chemical basis to a problem is more important to the student than the formal mathematical reduction of poorly gathered data.

Yet the question remains that - if women&#39;s bodies are designed to give birth without intervention for the majority of the time - why is this necessary? This book explores the paradox between physiological birth and the routine &#39;need&#39; for anti-D and highlights some interesting evidence which may throw light on this paradox. Are women&#39;s bodies really fallible, or could some women&#39;s need for anti-D be caused by medical intervention in childbirth? Do women being offered anti-D know that this is a blood product which may carry attendent risks?

As she shares their stories and those of their friends, neighbors, and business associates, she illuminates the greater history of African-American elites in New York City.</p><p><i>Black Gotham</i> challenges many of the accepted "truths" about African-American history, including the assumption that the phrase "nineteenth-century black Americans" means enslaved people, that "New York state before the Civil War" refers to a place of freedom, and that a black elite did not exist until the twentieth century. Beginning her story in the 1820s, Peterson focuses on the pupils of the Mulberry Street School, the graduates of which went on to become eminent African-American leaders. She traces their political activities as well as their many achievements in trade, business, and the professions against the backdrop of the expansion of scientific racism, the trauma of the Civil War draft riots, and the rise of Jim Crow.</p><p>Told in a vivid, fast-paced style, <i>Black Gotham</i> is an important account of the rarely acknowledged achievements of nineteenth-century African Americans and brings to the forefront a vital yet forgotten part of American history and culture.</p></p><p><p><b>Carla L.

Brandeis: American Prophet</i><br>"This book provides a powerful, much needed response to mounting criticism of the robust freedom of speech enshrined in US culture and law. Individuals from many sectors of our society that have traditionally championed free speech&#x2014;including academics, students, writers, and liberals/progressives&#x2014;have increasingly advocated curbs on speech by certain disfavored speakers or that conveys certain disfavored messages.

While fairly recognizing that speech can and does cause harm to individuals and society, he demonstrates that government censorship causes immeasurably greater harm."&#x2014;Nadine Strossen, Former President, American Civil Liberties Union<br></p><h2>Midnight: Three Women at the Hour of Reckoning</h2><p><p><strong>Exquisite and nuanced in its storytelling, <em>Midnight</em> crafts intimate, humanizing portraits of Jane Austen, Mary Shelley, and Joan of Arc that ask us to behold the women behind the icons.</strong></p><p><em>Midnight</em> is a study in the courage of three women&#x2015;Jane Austen, Mary Shelley, and Joan of Arc. Jane Austen was poor in 1802, unmarried and homeless. She had outlines, ideas, and first drafts of her future novels but no place to sit and write them. It is at this bleak moment that she receives an offer of marriage from a rich man. <em>Midnight</em> takes us to the hour of her decision between financial security and her writing life.</p><p>When sixteen-year-old Mary Godwin elopes to France with the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, she scoffs at the cost&#x2015;life as an outcast. Together they travel through Europe, reading and writing, but <em>Midnight</em> finds her alone, eight years later, pacing a terrace overlooking the Italian shore, watching for Shelley to sail home over stormy seas in a shaky boat.</p><p>Joan of Arc, imprisoned in chains, kept her faith for a long year. Be brave, daughter of God, her saints had whispered, you will be saved&#x2015;and she believes it, until she is taken to be burned at the stake. <em>Midnight</em> is the story of Joan&#x2019;s final days, between her terrified recantation and her heroic return to the stake.</p></p><p>Victoria Shorr&#x2019;s first novel,&nbsp;Backlands, was named one of Booklist&#x2019;s top-ten first novels of 2015.

You simply pop it into your PC and reboot. Whether the computer has Windows, Linux, or nothing at all installed on it, the live CD hands you control of that computer, using the operating system, applications, and data on that CD.</p><p>That's when the fun begins.</p><p>Today dozens of live CDs based on Linux are available for purchase or free download from the Internet. Some of the live CDs are made as general desktop Linux systems (such as Knoppix). Others are built as specialized toolkits, as with the BackTrack Security CD or Dynabolic multimedia production CD. Still others are made to run specialized systems, as with the Devil Linux firewall CD or the ParallelKnoppix cluster live CD.</p><p>The goal of this book is to introduce you to the world of Linux live CDs and then take you as far as you want to go with it. You might just want to try out some existing live CDs (we give you some to try). If you like a particular live CD, you might want to save settings and data across reboots. Or, eventually, you might want to build a live CD completely customized to your desires.</p><p>This book starts pretty basically with how to use live CDs, but the ultimate goal is to help you make the exact live CD you want. For example, with procedures in this book, you can end up with a Linux live CD that does the following:</p><ul><li>Boots directly to a presentation or slide show (Chapter 10)</li><li>Lets you add software to a running security toolkit (Chapter 9)</li><li>Includes your own movies or music with a player set to play them (Chapter 12)</li><li>Acts as a personal firewall live CD to protect your LAN (Chapter 13)</li><li>Can configure cluster computing among a group of computers (Chapter 14)</li><li>Lets you set up a gaming console or server from any available PC (Chapter 11)</li></ul><p>If you are partial to a particular Linux distribution, you can probably find a live CD described here that's built on that distribution. For example, in Chapters 6&#x2013;8, we describe how to build live CDs based on Knoppix (Debian), Fedora, and Gentoo Linux distributions. BackTrack (Chapter 9) is based on SLAX (a slackware CD). The presentation live CD (Chapter 10) is built on Damn Small Linux.</p><p>If you want to dig deeper into building your own live CD, the book includes description of core technology. You learn how to work with boot loaders, make compressed file systems, and follow (and adapt) the boot process from the time the machine turns on until you see a working desktop or shell prompt.</p><p><b>Audience for This Book</b></p><p>If you have never used Linux, live CDs are a great way to try out different types of Linux systems. Chances are, you will be able to follow along quite comfortably for a few chapters, trying out some live CD desktop systems, games, and various applications. You should even be able to learn how to save your desktop files and settings without much trouble.</p><p>As you enter the second part of the book, however, some knowledge of Linux is useful (if not necessary). You don't need to be a programmer to remaster a live CD or even build one from scratch. However, a working knowledge of how to use the shell, a text editor, and shell commands are needed as you move into the more technical areas of the book.</p><p><b>Organization of This Book</b></p><p>This book follows the charter of the new Negus Live Linux Series to get hands-on experience quickly, dig in deeply to key components, and then step through how to get real, specific results. To that end, this book is divided into three major parts:</p><ul><li><b>Part I, "Beginning with Bootable Live Linuxes"</b>&#x2014;This is the Linux live CD "user" part of the book. It is designed to get your hands on a working live CD within a few minutes. You will tour a few Linux live CDs and then learn some basics about boot options, customizing your desktop, and ways to save your data to hard disk or removable media.</li><li><b>Part II, "Creating a Custom Bootable Linux"</b>&#x2014;In this part, I get deeper into the inner workings of a live CD. You will learn about boot loaders, file systems used on live CDs, and the init process. The last three chapters are dedicated to remastering or customizing live CDs based on Knoppix (Chapter 6), Fedora (Chapter 7), or Gentoo (Chapter 8).</li><li><p><b>Part III, "Making a Specialized Bootable Linux"</b>&#x2014;Because creating a Linux live CD involves more than just running a few scripts and burning CDs, this part focuses on specific types of live CDs that might interest you. For different types of live CDs (security, gaming, multimedia, firewall, and so on), one or two live CDs are showcased. </p><p>From each live CD category chapter, you can learn about the types of components in that type of live CD so you can begin thinking about what you might put into a live CD of that type. In some cases, you will learn how to use tools from the featured live CD to quickly personalize it. For example, you could learn to add your own presentations or slide shows to the bootable presentation live CD (Chapter 10), add movies to a multimedia player live CD (Chapter 12), or add software to a SLAX live CD (Chapter 9).</p></li></ul><p>The two appendices provide some supporting information. Appendix A, "On the DVD," describes the contents of the DVD. Appendix B, "Building, Testing, and Burning ISOs," goes into some depth about tools touched on throughout the book for making ISO images (mkisofs command), testing them (qemu emulator), and burning images to disks (cdrecord or K3b).</p><p><b>About the DVD for This Book</b></p><p>The DVD that comes with this book offers a wide array of live CDs. Several of the CDs have been remastered so you can boot to them directly from the DVD's boot prompt. Others are available as complete ISO images that you can copy from the DVD and burn to individual CDs.</p><p>If you are just starting out with Live CDs, I recommend that you boot the DVD and select to boot the Knoppix live CD contained on the DVD. For a listing of the software contained on the DVD, refer to Appendix A.</p><p><b>What You Need to Use This Book</b></p><p>Linux live CDs are available to run on a range of computer hardware, such as standard PC architecture (i386), PowerPC (ppc), and 64-bit AMD (AMD64). Some Linux live CD tools let you build for the architecture you like (such as the Gentoo Catalyst installer). For the purpose of this book, however, the software we provide and the procedures are geared toward the standard 32-bit PC architecture.</p><p>The PC you use to follow along with this book requires a DVD drive or a CD drive (if you can burn your own ISO images to CD). Although each live CD has its own minimum hardware requirements, I suggest starting with at least a Pentium-class PC and at least 128MB of RAM. As noted later in this book, live CDs (by nature) consume a lot of RAM and will run poorly in low-RAM environments.</p><p>As for hard-disk requirements, you don't even need to have a hard disk in the computer to run the live CDs included with this book. However, if you are remastering a live CD or building one from scratch, the amount of hard-disk space can range from a few hundred megabytes (to remaster Damn Small Linux) to several gigabytes of disk space. The space you need depends on how much software you are adding to your live CD (or live DVD).</p><p>You might consider getting a USB flash drive (also sometimes called a pen drive or thumb drive). Because live CDs are typically run from read-only media, USB flash drives are good to keep handy in case you want to save any of the data you create.</p><br><p>� Copyright Pearson Education.

This book fills a critical gap in our understanding of a long-neglected facet of the critical thinking process: reflective judgment. Drawing on extensive cross-sectional and longitudinal research, including their own ten-year study, Patricia M. King and Karen Strohm Kitchener detail the series of stages that lay the foundation for reflective thinking, and they trace the development of reflective judgment through adolescence and adulthood.King and Kitchener's new model of reflective judgment is designed to enhance both research and practice in the areas of critical thinking, intellectual development, and education. The authors examine key questions concerning reflective judgment: How do high school, college, and graduate students reason differently about ill-structured problems? Does students' reasoning improve with additional exposure to and involvement in higher education? Do adult learners differ from traditional-age students in their reflective thinking? How does the reasoning of adult college graduates differ from that of non-college-educated adults? The authors also describe the implications of the Reflective Judgment Model for working with students in the classroom and beyond&#x2014;encouraging educators to think differently about interactions with their students and to create ways of more effectively promoting the ability to make reflective judgments.PATRICIA M.

During the Vietnam War, &#x201c;Project Popeye&#x201d; was an American attempt to lengthen the monsoon and cause delays on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Soldiers have always known just how significant mud can be in war. But historians have not fully recognized its importance, and few have discussed the phenomenon in more than a passing manner. Only three books&#x2014;<i>Military Geography</i> (by John Collins), <i>Battling the Elements</i> (by Harold Winters et al.), and <i>Battlegrounds</i>) (edited by Michael Stephenson)&#x2014; have addressed it at any length and then only as part of the entire environment&#x2019;s effect on the battlefield. None of these books analyzed mud&#x2019;s influence on the individual combatant. <i>Mud: A Military History</i> first defines the substance&#x2019;s very different types. Then it examines their specific effects on mobility and on soldiers and their equipment over the centuries and throughout the world. From the Russian rasputiza to the Southeast Asian monsoon, C. E. Wood demonstrates mud&#x2019;s profound impact on the course of military history. Citing numerous veterans&#x2019; memoirs, archival sources, personal interviews, and historical sources, soldier-scholar Wood pays particular attention to mud&#x2019;s effect on combatants&#x2019; morale, health, and fatigue. His book is for all infantrymen&#x2014;past, present, or the clean, dry, comfortable armchair variety.</p><p><p>"C. E. Wood's book is the first examination of mud throughout military history and its importance in battle, from Waterloo to Iraq, as a significant element. . . . This is a fascinating and quick read.

JULES VERNE (1828-1905) was internationally famous as the author of novels based on extraordinary voyages. His visionary use of new travel technologies inspired his readers to look to the industrial future rather than the remote past for their dreams of adventure. The popularity of his novels led directly to modern science fiction. In From the Earth to the Moon and Around the Moon, Jules Verne turned the ancient fantasy of space flight into a believable technological possibility an engineering dream for the industrial age. Directly inspired by Verne s story, enthusiasts worked successfully at overcoming the practical difficulties, and within a century, human beings did indeed fly to the Moon. Curiously, however, Verne is unlikely to have thought it possible that a manned projectile could actually be fired out of a giant cannon, rising higher than the Moon, swinging around it, and then landing safely back on Earth.

Kuhn tells the remarkable five-century story of Chinese emigration as an integral part of China&#39;s modern history. Although emigration has a much longer past, its &#39;modern&#39; phase dates from the sixteenth century, when European colonialists began to collaborate with Chinese emigrants to develop a worldwide trading system. The author explores both internal and external migration, complementary parts of a far-reaching process of adaptation that enabled Chinese families to deal with their changing social environments. Skills and institutions developed in the course of internal migration were creatively modified to serve the needs of emigrants in foreign lands. As emigrants, Chinese inevitably found themselves &#39;among others.&#39; The various human ecologies in which they lived have faced Chinese settlers with a diversity of challenges and opportunities in the colonial and postcolonial states of Southeast Asia, in the settler societies of the Americas and Australasia, and in Europe. Kuhn traces their experiences worldwide alongside those of the &#39;others&#39; among whom they settled: the colonial elites, indigenous peoples, and rival immigrant groups that have profited from their Chinese minorities but also have envied, feared, and sometimes persecuted them. A rich selection of primary sources allows these protagonists a personal voice to express their hopes, sorrows, and worldviews. The post-Mao era offers emigrants new opportunities to leverage their expatriate status to do business with a Chinese nation eager for their investments, donations, and technologies. The resulting &#39;new migration,&#39; the author argues, is but the latest phase of a centuries-old process by which Chinese have sought livelihoods away from home.</p><p>Philip A. Kuhn is Francis Lee Higginson Professor of History and East Asian Languages and Civilizations, emeritus, at Harvard University.Kuhn's experience in studying Chinese history enables him to offer an interesting perspective on Chinese migration in <i>Chinese Among Others</i>. The book is noteworthy for its ambitious global scope. Kuhn's insightful main argument contends that there is a symbiotic relationship between modern Chinese history and the history of Chinese migration. <i>Chinese Among Others</i> has broken new ground in providing such food for thought. (Leander Seah <i>Chinese Studies</i>)<br><br><i>Chinese Among Others</i> is the first book to attempt a synthetic history of Chinese migration around the world from the sixteenth century to the present. . . . [L]ively and accessible . . . appropriate for undergraduate courses while retaining complexity and diverse insights for the specialist. . . . [A] timely achievement that both summarizes the state of the field and offers distinct interpretations, helping readers take stock and move forward in new directions. (Adam McKeown <i>Journal of Asian Studies</i>)<br><br>Kuhn's conceptual clarity, the enlightening way in which he weaves the story of Chinese migration into both national and global histories, and his vivid writing&#x2015;supplemented with excerpts from primary sources&#x2015;makes it an excellent text for students. (<i>The China Journal</i>)<br><br>This is a rich and well-written narrative of great ambition, erudition, and insight. It offers compelling and carefully constructed bridges between the fields of Chinese, ethnic, and migration studies. (<i>Journal of American Ethnic History</i>)<br><br>Demonstrating his remarkable historical and historiographical knowledge, Philip A. Kuhn&#x2019;s Chinese Among Others is the most comprehensive synthetic account of the saga of the modern Chinese diaspora. Nobody else before him has captured the long and complicated process of the Chinese diaspora so clearly and so insightfully. This book represents a landmark in the study of this extremely important topic. . . . This well-researched and well-written book represents a monumental step toward establishing the studies of the Chinese diaspora as a coherent field of inquiry. (Yong Chen <i>H-Net: Humanities and Social Science Reviews Online</i>)<br><br>Philip Kuhn has written a comprehensive history of the Chinese diaspora, from premodern southern Chinese maritime networks to transformations wrought by colonialism and war in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Crisply written and sympathetic but not sentimental, <i>Chinese Among Others</i> is magisterial in sweep, concept, and execution. (Mae M. Ngai, Columbia University)<br><br>Philip Kuhn dug deep into the history of China before turning to pursue the many generations of Chinese migrants around the world. He has an astute sensitivity for the lives of dislodged peoples and an exceptional capacity to find the core issues in the subject. This is a remarkable book that offers a unique contribution to the growing field of diasporic Chinese history. (Wang Gungwu, National University of Singapore)<br><br>Philip Kuhn has long been urging us to study the Chinese globally, and in this benchmark volume he skillfully weaves together a tapestry of world Chinese history. (Edgar Wickberg, University of British Columbia)<br><br>An impressive work. The very conception, a world-historical treatment of the Chinese diaspora, is original. For me, the intellectual excitement comes from the fresh perspective that Kuhn qua consummate historian brings to subject matter more often treated in fragmentary fashion by social scientists. Novel conceptualizations and interpretations abound. Kuhn's research is meticulous and his writing is clear. This book will command the attention of China scholars and widen their horizons. (G.

David Caplan's stylish study examines hip-hop's central but supposedly outmoded verbal technique: rhyme. At a time when print-based poets generally dismiss formal rhyme as old-fashioned and bookish, hip-hop artists deftly deploy it as a way to capture the contemporary moment. Rhyme accommodates and colorfully chronicles the most conspicuous conditions and symbols of contemporary society: its products, technologies, and personalities. Ranging from Shakespeare and Wordsworth to Eminem and Jay-Z, David Caplan's study demonstrates the continuing relevance of rhyme to poetry -- and everyday life.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Caplan</strong> is Charles M. Weis Chair in English and Associate Director of Creative Writing at Ohio Wesleyan University. His previous books include <em>Questions of Possibility: Contemporary Poetry and Poetic Form</em> and the poetry collection <em>In the World He Created According to His Will</em>.<br><br>"A refreshingly serious and stimulating consideration of the formal tendencies of hip hop, Caplan's study infuses previous readings of hip hop's social concerns and historical situations with an exacting look at the pleasures and ramifications of rhyme." <br>--Yasmine Shamma, <em>Poetry Magazine</em> (Poetryfoundation.org) <br><p></p><br>"Ultimately, this is a hopeful book, one that sees flux as a positive and that sees analysis as an aid to enjoying art in all its facets and embodiments, from the commercial to the high brow...the increasing influence of hip hop will continue to challenge contemporary poets to see rhyme not as a stale technique but as an energizing one." <br>--Charlotte Pense, <em>The Rumpus</em> <br><p></p><br>"In <em>Rhyme's Challenge</em> David Caplan makes the case that rhymes live all around us and express themselves most evocatively in hip hop. He draws rich connections across music, culture, law, politics, science, and beyond. This is a rare kind of book: rooted but daring, learned but hip. It bears out Chuck D's claim that 'what counts is that the rhyme's / Designed to fill your mind.' Caplan cares deeply about rhyme; after reading this book, so will you." --Adam Bradley, author of <em>Book of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop</em><p></p><br>"If you want to see the very traditional techniques of literary analysis prove their worth once more, if you want to see what those techniques can do for, with, and about Big Daddy Kane and Missy Elliot, Jay-Z and Lupe Fiasco, there's no substitute for the close reading and closer listening Caplan provides; and if you want to see what rap's techniques (not just its subjects; its techniques) contribute to present-day page-based poetry, from Major Jackson to D. A. Powell, Caplan's work is surely a, if not the, place to go. You might even go from it back to the rappers themselves." --Stephen Burt, author of <em>Close Calls with Nonsense</em><p></p><br>"Intriguing...Makes a strong case that there is more to hip-hop in terms of artistry than is often granted." --<em>The American Conservative</em><p></p><br>"David Caplan's Rhyme's Challenge: Hip Hop, Poetry, and Contemporary Rhyming Culture is a much needed book because it examines the significance of rhymes in American hip hop across races and cultures. After a brief analysis of the significance of rhymes in contemporary American culture generally, Caplan provides a thorough study of the importance of poetry in African-American hip hop. His book is groundbreaking." -- <em>Popular Music and Society</em><p></p><br>"[Caplan] identifies a striking truth, namely that hip-hop lyricists adore rhyme, whereas contemporary print-based poets largely avoid it. Using strong close readings and rich literary contextualization, he argues that rap artists leveraged a rapidly expanding English language to champion rhyming, a poetic technique that had fallen victim to changing creative tastes . . . Caplan's efforts herald important new options for analyzing rap." --<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"Organized through topics like insult and seduction, <em>Rhyme's Challenge</em> is mindful of subject matter but inclines toward an intensively close reading of other formal elements. [I]t is the precision and insight of Caplan's analyses that leave the strongest impression, along with his concluding argument that hip hop has already had an influence on a generation <br>of print-based poets of various races, which is likely to persist as this century continues." --<em>American Literary History</em><p></p><br>"Finely articulated, <em>Rhyme's Challenge</em> demonstrates Caplan's creativity, command of language, and rich and varied use of sources...Caplan presents a thoughtful, intricate, and persuasive text that will serve as a catalyst for scholars willing to accept his challenge." --<em>The Bulletin of the Society</em> <em>for American Music</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Operations Management: Processes and Supply Chains, Student Value Edition (11th Edition)</h2><p><br>NOTE: You are purchasing a standalone product; MyOMLab does not come packaged with this content.

It is a story set in the time of Prince Edward, of house Tudor, who at age nine would become King Edward VI. When young Prince Edward meets a Pauper, Tom Canty, who likes a lot like him, he convinces the two to switch clothes so that they can be mistaken for each other and end up switching places. While they play out their new roles, Prince Edward learns of the struggles of the commoners of England while Tom discovers what it is like to be a Prince and then a King. Twain wrote with regards to his novel that, &#x201c;My idea is to afford a realizing sense of the exceeding severity of the laws of that day by inflicting some of their penalties upon the King himself and allowing him a chance to see the rest of them applied to others. . .&#x201d; A delightfully comedic tale, &#x201c;The Prince and the Pauper&#x201d; is at its heart a social commentary on judging others simply by their appearance.

These books use excerpts from the major texts to explain essential topics, such as the definition and role of God in the Bible, the most influential book in human history.<br><br> The trouble with reading the Bible is that it claims to be God&#x2019;s autobiography; so the first thing readers must do is decide what they understand about God and how they are going to interpret his role in the rambling library of books that claims his authorship. Richard Holloway offers a usefully dialectical approach to this central question that will allow unbelievers as well as believers to profit from a study of the most influential book in human history.</p><p><p><strong>Richard Holloway</strong> is a former Bishop of Edinburgh and Gresham Professor of Divinity.

Half a millennium later, Andy Warhol made a game of "forging" the Mona Lisa, questioning the entire concept of originality.<br><br><em>Forged</em> explores art forgery from ancient times to the present. In chapters combining lively biography with insightful art criticism, Jonathon Keats profiles individual art forgers and connects their stories to broader themes about the role of forgeries in society. From the Renaissance master Andrea del Sarto who faked a Raphael masterpiece at the request of his Medici patrons, to the Vermeer counterfeiter Han van Meegeren who duped the avaricious Hermann G�ring, to the frustrated British artist Eric Hebborn, who began forging to expose the ignorance of experts, art forgers have challenged "legitimate" art in their own time, breaching accepted practices and upsetting the status quo. They have also provocatively confronted many of the present-day cultural anxieties that are major themes in the arts. Keats uncovers what forgeries--and our reactions to them--reveal about changing conceptions of creativity, identity, authorship, integrity, authenticity, success, and how we assign value to works of art. The book concludes by looking at how artists today have appropriated many aspects of forgery through such practices as street-art stenciling and share-and-share-alike licensing, and how these open-source "copyleft" strategies have the potential to make legitimate art meaningful again. <br><br>Forgery has been much discussed--and decried--as a crime. <em>Forged</em> is the first book to assess great forgeries as high art in their own right.<br></p><p><p><b>A Field Guide To 20th Century Art Forgers: by Jonathon Keats</b></p> <p>Riccardo Riccardi and Alfredo Fioravanti</p> <p>For nearly half a century, the Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibited several counterfeit statues of Etruscan warriors incompetently crafted by Riccardo Riccardi and Alfredo Fioravanti, two boys from a small town near Rome who had no idea what authentic Etruscan artifacts looked like. Despite the skepticism of outside experts, the oddly proportioned figures were kept on view in order to avoid institutional embarrassment, enshrining for several generations an arrestingly strange Etruscan aesthetic that never existed in ancient days.</p> <p><strong>Jean Charles Millet</strong></p> <p>The grandson of the Barbizon painter Jean-Fran�ois Millet, Jean Charles Millet exploited the family name &#x2013; and a stencil Jean-Fran�ois had made for signing his paintings &#x2013; by employing a deaf housepainter named Paul Cazot to copy his grandfather's canvases by the hundred. Charged with forgery, Millet defended himself in French court by saying he sold his fakes only to Americans and Englishmen, arguing that he couldn't be blamed for their ignorance. Eventually he was convicted, but only for passing bad checks.</p> <p><strong>Yves Chaudron</strong></p> <p>Following the theft of the Mona Lisa in 1911, Leonardo's masterpiece was illicitly offered for private sale to six different collectors, each of whom received a copy painted by Yves Chaudron. The con worked because the collectors had all heard about the missing original, but each had to keep his illegal purchase secret. It would have been the perfect crime, if only it were real. Later research has shown that Chaudron himself was a fake, fabricated by the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> journalist Karl Decker, a forger's forger. </p> <p><strong>Han van Meegeren</strong></p> <p>The eminent art historian Abraham Bredius believed that Vermeer once went through a religious phase, and that paintings from that period would eventually be discovered. Han van Meegeren helped Bredius to prove his theory by fabricating a Vermeer on a Biblical theme and having it submitted to Bredius for authentication. Though van Meegeren's painting bore no resemblance to authentic Vermeers in terms of content or quality, Bredius declared it a masterpiece. On the strength of that endorsement, van Meegeren made more 'Vermeers'. And the more of them he made, the more convincing all of them became as the growing body of work changed how people viewed Vermeer's actual paintings. </p> <p><strong>Lothar Malskat</strong></p> <p>Hired to restore a Gothic church in the West German town of L�beck in the 1950s, the art conservator Lothar Malskat exceeded expectations by discovering a whole cycle of medieval frescos. Only after two million postage stamps had been printed to celebrate the find did Malskat reveal that he'd made the murals himself, modeling his Biblical figures on school friends and movie stars. Even after the trial, the L�beck government debated keeping the paintings, loathe to give up the town's newfound popularity with art enthusiasts. Some of the murals remain in place today, six decades after the scandal. Guidebooks don't mention they're fakes.</p> <p><strong>Elmyr de Hory </strong></p> <p>The storied life of Elmyr de Hory, master forger of paintings by Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, is known primarily through a biography written by Clifford Irving in the late 1960s, a source that is questionable not only on account of de Hory's characteristic self-mythologizing &#x2013; including a make-believe aristocratic upbringing &#x2013; but also because of his biographer's next project: Irving's attempted forgery of Howard Hughes's memoirs. The combination of myth and mystery has made de Hory's known forgeries so highly collectable in their own right that de Hory copies are often now forged. </p> <p><strong>Tom Keating</strong></p> <p>Frustrated as an artist, Tom Keating set out to prove the art world's stupidity by forging drawings and paintings by past greats ranging from John Constable to Amedeo Modigliani, in many cases including what he called "time bombs" &#x2013; such as underpainting messages in lead white that would be revealed by x-rays &#x2013; to flaunt the paintings' fraudulence years after they'd been bought. The British public embraced his anti-elitist cause following his eventual confession, garnering a large audience for his TV series teaching everybody how to paint like the masters: his ultimate revenge. </p> <p><strong>David Stein</strong></p> <p>After he was convicted of counterfeiting modern masters including Pablo Picasso and Marc Chagall in the late 1960s, the French art forger David Stein began signing his own name to his fakes, and even having some of them featured as movie props in <i>The Moderns</i>. It was ideal cover for his ongoing illicit production of forgeries essentially identical to the paintings for which he was taking public credit. </p> <p><strong>Konrad Kujau</strong></p> <p>Konrad Kujau made his living defrauding neo-Nazis and nostalgically fascist Germans by supplying them with memorabilia falsely attributed to Hitler, including nude paintings of Eva Braun, pages from an opera, and ultimately the Fuhrer's personal diaries, which were duly published in Stern. Many who were duped seem to have known it, deeming the money they gave Kujau a small price to pay for 'evidence' of Hitler's culture and humanity. </p> <p><strong>Eric Hebborn</strong></p> <p>Counterfeiting drawings and paintings by old masters from Rubens to Brueghel, Eric Hebborn delighted in boasting about his achievements, publishing a handbook sharing his techniques for faking pigments, and claiming that numerous works in public collections were his creations. While some were, others he identified as fakes were genuine, though no amount of scholarship has fully overcome the taint of doubt. </p><br><strong>Jonathon Keats</strong> is a critic, journalist and artist.

Without them the Pentateuch would stop cold and the Prophets would hang in suspension. Even the Psalms and Wisdom literature would lose some of their luster for lack of a setting. Without these historical books the New Testament would be resolving an incomplete narrative, answering a question only half and hesitantly posed. For all these reasons and more, it is a tragic fact that many of us today cannot give a brief and coherent account of this story. We fear that books with names like Judges, Kings and Chronicles would bore us. But nothing could be further from the truth. For the story they tell is full of action and intrigue, tragedy and suspense, vivid characters and memorable events. They are the stuff of great art and literature, and they have inspired men and women to lives and deeds of uncommon faith and courage. Exploring these books is essential for a true education, whether religious or otherwise. In this guidebook, Philip E. Satterthwaite and J. Gordon McConville introduce us to the content and the context of these historical books. We view them within the setting of ancient history and history writing, and come to appreciate their literary artistry, their role within the Scriptures of Israel, and their lasting value as theological and ethical resources. Designed especially for students, <em>Exploring the Old Testament, Volume 2: A Guide to the Historical Books</em> overflows with interesting and helpful features that encourage avid exploration and the joy of learning.</p><p></p><h2>Portfolio Presentation for Fashion Designers</h2><p>Designer's portfolios are their calling card in an increasingly competitive fashion industry--displaying their unique design perspective, skill sets, and creativity.

His self-importance, utter lack of imagination, and ultimately middle-class outlook on the world around him is Lewis's unsentimental portrayal of post World War 1 small-town America. Despite George's vague dissatisfaction with his life, which he tried to change by "embracing" liberalism and beginning an affair with an attractive widow, he finds that the seeds of rebellion are just not within him, that he fears being an outcast more than he regrets his mundane life.</p></p><p>In the fall of 1920, Sinclair Lewis began a novel set in a fast-growing city with the heart and mind of a small town. For the center of his cutting satire of American business he created the bustling, shallow, and myopic George F. Babbitt, the epitome of middle-class mediocrity. The novel cemented Lewis's prominence as a social commentator. <br>Babbitt basks in his pedestrian success and the popularity it has brought him. He demands high moral standards from those around him while flirting with women, and he yearns to have rich friends while shunning those less fortunate than he. But Babbitt's secure complacency is shattered when his best friend is sent to prison, and he struggles to find meaning in his hollow life.

Although the authors emphasize the importance of cooking with food that&#x2019;s in season, readers will be quickly tipped off that this isn&#x2019;t your average Tuscan, fresh cooking cookbook once they look at the "basic ingredients" list, which includes caul (a thin membrane lining the abdominal cavity of pigs and sheep), caviar, foie gras, porcini mushrooms and truffles. The recipes are elegant yet, for the most part, not stuffy: Golden Scallops Salad, Grilled Sliced Tuna with Giant White Beans and Romanesco, and "Guitar String" Pasta with Red Shrimp and Baby Zucchini. All of them demonstrate the Mantuanos&#x2019; penchant for mixing unusual but complementary flavors. Still, the book&#x2019;s complex dishes, such as Seared Foie Gras with White Corn Polenta and Quince with Passito di Moscato Syrup, may deter more casual home cooks.

In addition to symbolic recognition of indigenous peoples and black populations, governments in the region created a more pluralistic model of citizenship and made significant reforms in the areas of land, health, education, and development policy. <i>Becoming Black Political Subjects</i> explores this shift from color blindness to ethno-racial legislation in two of the most important cases in the region: Colombia and Brazil.</p><p>Drawing on archival and ethnographic research, Tianna Paschel shows how, over a short period, black movements and their claims went from being marginalized to become institutionalized into the law, state bureaucracies, and mainstream politics. The strategic actions of a small group of black activists&#x2015;working in the context of domestic unrest and the international community's growing interest in ethno-racial issues&#x2015;successfully brought about change. Paschel also examines the consequences of these reforms, including the institutionalization of certain ideas of blackness, the reconfiguration of black movement organizations, and the unmaking of black rights in the face of reactionary movements.</p><p><i>Becoming Black Political Subjects</i> offers important insights into the changing landscape of race and Latin American politics and provokes readers to adopt a more transnational and flexible understanding of social movements.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Becoming Black Political Subjects</i> adroitly crosses disciplines to parse out the legal, ideational, and institutional implications of black political mobilization in Colombia and Brazil. Tianna Paschel ferrets out the tensions between activists and organizations identified with state power on the one hand, and more popular forms of consciousness raising and mobilization on the other.

This groundbreaking book is political sociology at its best."<b>--Gianpaolo Baiocchi, New York University</b></p><p>"This carefully argued, deeply researched book maps the dramatic transformation of an older model of Latin American nationalism--predicated in part on disprivileging black subjects--to a model seeking racial equality.

How to Run a Country collects the best of these writings to provide an entertaining, common sense guide for modern leaders and citizens. This brief book, a sequel to <i>How to Win an Election</i>, gathers Cicero's most perceptive thoughts on topics such as leadership, corruption, the balance of power, taxes, war, immigration, and the importance of compromise.

In chapters on diction, syntax, tone, meaning, composition, and revision, Barzun describes and prescribes the techniques to correct even the most ponderous style. Exercises, model passages &#x2014; both literary and unorthodox &#x2014; and hundreds of often amusing examples of usage gone wrong demonstrate the process of making intelligent choices and guide us toward developing strong and distinctive prose.</p><p>Rare is the book that causes one to consider--ponder? appraise? examine? inspect? contemplate?--one's every word. <i>Simple &amp; Direct</i>, a classic text on the craft of writing by the educator Jacques Barzun, does so--with style. His object, says Barzun, is "to resensitize the mind to words." Do not use a word unless you know both its meaning and its connotations, its "quality" and its "atmosphere," and the ways in which it joins with other words. Barzun is an exacting taskmaster, railing against abstractions, "fancy" wordings, contemporary slang (which "prey[s] upon the vocabulary rather than nourish[es] it"), misprints ("it is rudeness to let them appear"), and the like. He bemoans what he sees as "a fury at work in the people to make war on hyphens," and he loathes those new words, such as condominium, that have been "cobbled together out of shavings and leftovers." <p> Still, no stodgy codger he. Barzun merely asks that you "have a point and make it by means of the best word." If that means splitting an infinitive or substituting a "which" for a "that," so be it. Just be sure that the decision to do so is conscious and informed.

Their careers illustrate the early transformation of actresses into marketable commodities whose celebrity status depended on the consumption of their images. This celebrity, in turn, was used to market an array of beauty and fashion goods to women striving to emulate them.</p><p>The three women featured in <i>Staging Fashion</i> exemplify the factors that ensured success for 20th-century actresses. Each of these women was dressed by a leading couturier (or several couturiers), both onstage and offstage. In major cities such as New York, Paris, and London, actresses depended on exquisite, custom-made gowns both to secure principal roles and to maintain popularity. Their physical beauty, which was consistent with elite notions of class and race, was depicted on postcards and in popular fashion and theatre magazines and newspapers. Finally, these actresses developed distinct "personalities," which were conveyed by their stage roles and in numerous photos and articles.</p></p><p><b>Michele Majer</b> is an assistant professor at the Bard Graduate Center, New York, and a research associate at Cora Ginsburg LLC, New York.&#x201c;The catalogue produced by the center and distributed by Yale University Press is as intimate and lovingly put together as the show."&#x2014;<i>Studio International</i> (<i>Studio International</i>)<br><br>"The editor offers an important glimpse into the worlds of both fashion and theater and the interrelationship of the two. . . .

Tour.</p><p>By the time he suddenly succeeded to the presidency in November 1963, following John Kennedy's assassination, Lyndon Johnson had been secretly recording his private conversations for years--first by having an eavesdropping aide take shorthand notes on telephone calls, and then, as recording technology advanced, by committing conversations to tape. Even on his first night as president, he remembered to make sure that the tape recorder was working. His motives were apparently practical--a kind of hands-free note-taking, and a way to document the commitments he and others had made. <p> Whatever his reasons (and despite Johnson's desire that the documentation remain sealed until at least 2023), the tapes are a boon to students of politics and history. Masterfully edited and annotated by presidential historian Michael Beschloss, they reveal a quintessential political animal at work. It's fascinating to listen in as Johnson works the levers--cajoling, trading favors, calling in chits, twisting arms, and occasionally playing rough--often in a pungent, earthy Texas patois. The book covers the period from November 1963 through the Democratic convention in August 1964, when Johnson was nominated for reelection. Its biggest single revelation is that Johnson believed Fidel Castro was behind Kennedy's assassination; another, less sensational, is that his reservations about the deepening war in Vietnam were greater than previously known. Most importantly, though, these tapes provide an invaluable, uncensored look into a complex presidency--and president.</p><p><i>Taking Charge</i>, edited by Michael R. Beschloss, whom <i>Newsweek</i> has called "America's leading presidential historian," brings you into the room with an American political legend, still hated and revered a quarter century after his death. We hear Lyndon Johnson as he schemes and blusters, rewards and punishes, tells tales of Washington, D.C., and Texas, and reveals a bedrock core of unshakable political beliefs. </p><p> The only President to record his private conversations from his first day in office, LBJ ordered the tapes to be locked in a vault until at least the year 2023. But now they have been unsealed, providing a close-up look at a President taking power such as we have never had before -- from John F. Kennedy's murder in November 1963 to Johnson's campaign for a landslide victory. Michael Beschloss has transcribed and annotated the secretly recorded tapes, providing historical commentary that allows us to understand fully the people, crises, and controversies that appear on them. </p><p> <i>Taking Charge</i>, the first volume of <i>The Johnson White House Tapes</i>, is filled with revelations about the fullblooded Texan behind the public image. We hear LBJ telling who he thinks really killed JFK, creating the Warren Commission, staking his presidency on a revolutionary civil rights bill, scuttling Robert Kennedy's drive to be his Vice President, using the Tonkin Gulf attack to expand the American beachhead in Southeast Asia, and unveiling his private, tortured early doubts that we could ever win a war in Vietnam.</p></p><h2>Netter&#39;s Atlas of Human Anatomy for CPT Coding</h2><p>A reference for CPT code book users who want to understand the anatomic structures described within CPT codes.

But few know the rest of the story.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book aims to correct that. Lee Farrow offers here a detailed account of just what the Alaska Purchase was, how it came about, its impact at the time, and more. Farrow shows why both America and Russia had plenty of good reasons to want the sale to occur, including Russia&#x2019;s desire to let go of an unprofitable, hard-to-manage colony and the belief in the United States that securing Alaska could help the nation gain control of British Columbia and generate closer trade ties with Asia . Farrow also delves into the implications of the deal for foreign policy and international diplomacy far beyond Russia and the United States at a moment when the global balance of power was in question.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A thorough, readable retelling of a story we only think we know, <i>Seward&#x2019;s Folly</i> will become the standard book on the Alaska Purchase.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Lee A. Farrow </b>is distinguished teaching professor in the Department of History at Auburn University at Montgomery and director of Auburn&#x2019;s Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;A welcome addition to the growing literature on the history of Alaska, this work has a purpose, ably fulfilled, to examine circumstances that led US Secretary of State William Seward to acquire Alaska secretly for the US in 1867.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;&#x201c;There's a popular conception about the purchase of Alaska, which occurred 150 years ago this year. Russia had a toehold on its American colony but the company in charge of the possession wasn't turning a profit. So it was offered for sale to then-Secretary of State William Seward at a bargain price. Seward bought it and hilarity ensued. Americans mocked the purchase as little more than a frozen wasteland and derided Seward. Little more came of it until the Gold Rush three decades later. . . . Farrow places the purchase in its full context relative to both international geopolitics and the domestic situation in the United States in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War. It makes for an enlightening read.&#x201d; (<i>Alaska Dispatch News</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;(Lee) sets the purchase into several contexts, with chapters surveying briefly the history of Russian America, Stoeckl and Seward&#x2019;s relationship, public reaction to the purchase, appropriation of the money, conditions in Alaska after the purchase, international perceptions of the affair, and items that have put Alaska in the national news in recent years. . . . Farrow renders a significant service to general readers in dispensing with the long cherished canard that the purchase was unpopular.&#x201d; (<i>Alaska History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Tells the narrative story of the 1867 sale of Russian America to the U.S. clearly.

Barbara Tuchman called it "my Archimedes bathtub, my burning bush." But to Thomas Wolfe, it was a place of "wilderment and despair." Since its opening in 1915, the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library has led a spirited life as Harvard's physical and, in a sense, its spiritual heart. Originally intended as the memorial to one man, it quickly grew into a symbol of the life of the mind with few equals anywhere--and like all symbols, it has enjoyed its share of contest and contradiction. At the unlikely intersection of such disparate episodes as the sinking of the Titanic, the social upheavals of the 1960s, and the shifting meaning of books and libraries in the information age, Widener is at once the storehouse and the focus of rich and ever-growing hoards of memory. </p><p>With copious illustrations and wide-ranging narrative, <i>Widener: Biography of a Library</i> is not only a record of benefactors and collections; it is the tale of the students, scholars, and staff who give a great library its life.</p></p><p>Matthew Battles is Associate Director of metaLAB at Harvard University.&#x201c;<i>Widener: Biography of a Library</i> will be useful to anyone interested in the history of Harvard, the development of large academic libraries in the twentieth century, or the Widener in particular.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Willliam Martin</b><b>, </b><b><i>Libraries &amp; Culture</i></b></p><h2>Deals from Hell: M&amp;A Lessons that Rise Above the Ashes</h2><p>A detailed look at the worst M&amp;A deals ever and the lessons learned from them<br> <br> It's common knowledge that about half of all merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) transactions destroy value for the buyer's shareholders, and about three-quarters fall short of the expectations prevailing at the time the deal is announced. In Deals from Hell, Robert Bruner, one of the foremost thinkers and educators in this field, uncovers the real reasons for these mishaps by taking a closer look at twelve specific instances of M&amp;A failure. Through these real-world examples, he shows readers what went wrong and why, and converts these examples into cautionary tales for executives who need to know how they can successfully navigate their own M&amp;A deals. These page-turning business narratives in M&amp;A failure provide much-needed guidance in this area of business. By addressing the key factors to M&amp;A success and failure, this comprehensive guide illustrates the best ways to analyze, design, and implement M&amp;A deals. Filled with in-depth insights, expert advice, and valuable lessons gleaned from other M&amp;A transactions, Deals from Hell helps readers avoid the common pitfalls associated with this field and presents them with a clear framework for thinking about how to make any M&amp;A transaction a success.</p><p>Given the sheer complexity of M&amp;A deals, it's easy to see why so many of them fall short of their intended goals. Although mergers and acquisitions are no easy path to riches, it's definitely not a loser's game either. With the right attitude and understanding, it is possible to succeed in the world of mergers and acquisitions, and Robert Bruner, one of the foremost thinkers and educators in this field, wants to show you how. <p>The study of failure is the source of thoughtful advances, and in Deals from Hell: M&amp;A Lessons That Rise Above the Ashes, Bruner focuses on M&amp;A failures to help you achieve M&amp;A success. Comprised of three information-packed parts--The Foundations of M&amp;A Failure; Case Studies of M&amp;A Failures; and Avoiding the Deal from Hell--this comprehensive guide offers a realistic look at how M&amp;A transactions really work. </p><p>By addressing the key factors of M&amp;A failure and success, Deals from Hell illustrates the best ways to analyze, design, and implement your own M&amp;A deals. You'll gain valuable perspectives from the standpoint of previous research, and through ten real-world case studies, you'll discover how little an M&amp;A situation must differ in order to deliver rather different results. Some of the cases examined include: AOL and Time Warner The acquisition of Snapple by Quaker Oats The acquisition of Columbia Pictures by Sony Corporation Renault's proposed merger with Volvo Mattel's acquisition of The Learning Company The acquisition program of Tyco International </p><p>All of the cases presented are paired with a counterpoint or complementary case. The comparison cases are not intended to be deals from heaven--they're merely examples of how thin the line is between M&amp;Asuccess and failure. After you've become familiar with the research and cases outlined in the first two sections of the book, Bruner concludes his M&amp;A discussion with a look at the implications of these deals for CEOs, investors, and those concerned with public policy. </p><p>Filled with in-depth insights, expert advice, and valuable lessons gleaned from notably bad M&amp;A transactions, Deals from Hell will change the way you think about M&amp;A and help you understand--as well as anticipate--the obstacles to M&amp;A success.</p><p>PRAISE FOR Deals from Hell</p> <p>"Whether you are an investor or dealmaker, corporate executive or aspiring MBA looking for a career on Wall Street, you are sure to find this book both troublesome and inspiring...it cannot be otherwise when you carefully examine a series of M&amp;A 'train wrecks' through the same lens as Prof. Bruner, a creative teacher in the field of M&amp;A, who has been able to extract the hard, instructive lessons from these disasters." &#x2015;From the Foreword by Arthur Levitt Jr., former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and author of Take On the Street: What Wall Street and Corporate America Don't Want You to Know</p> <p>"Deals from Hell is a fresh and interesting look at the M&amp;A game written by Prof. Robert Bruner, a leading authority on the topic. He studies failures and from this unique perspective, teaches us the pitfalls to avoid as well as the positive actions for success. The case histories illuminated herein are worthy instruction for all CEOs and their top management team." &#x2015;Tom Copeland, Managing Director of Corporate Finance, Monitor Group</p> <p>"There is a very fine line between M&amp;A heaven and hell&#x2015;and it is no surprise that the devil is in the details. Contrary to conventional wisdom, mergers work, on average, as Bob Bruner documents&#x2015;and the reasons why are often worthy of more careful study than what appears beneath the headlines of the popular press. Bruner drills down on disasters and successes like no one else&#x2015;and leaves investors and M&amp;A dealmakers with a truly balanced scorecard of important lessons to ponder." &#x2015;Charles D. Ellis, author of Winning the Loser's Game and Capital: The Story of Long-Term Investment Excellence</p> <p>"While the average return to M&amp;A acquirers is a matter of some controversy, it is beyond question that many acquisitions work well and many work badly.

The look and feel of Shakespeare's London, the streets, shops, and churches the poet would have visited; the bookstalls where he found source material; the objects that appeared on his stages or sparked his imagination--what were they like?<br> <br> <em>Shakespeare: Staging the World</em> is based on an extraordinary collection of objects that evoke London in 1612, bringing to life not only Shakespeare the man, but also the characters, places, and events--real and imagined--featured in his plays. Jonathan Bate and Dora Thornton give readers a visual tour of Renaissance London, letting us glimpse the time and place through a series of objects that speak volumes about Shakespeare's day. Simon Forman's diary of 1611 provides a vivid account of attending a contemporary performance of <em>A Winter's Tale</em>; a dagger fished from the Thames gives new resonance to the gang violence of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>; Henry V's saddle, helm, and shield--medieval relics that would have been a familiar sight in Westminster Abbey to Shakespeare's fellow Londoners--recall the history plays and their examination of the nature and conduct of war; and Guy Fawkes's lantern illustrates the Catholic counterculture revealed through the failed Gunpowder Plot, which later provided the inspiration for <em>Macbeth</em>.<br> <br>Authoritative, evocative, and filled with surprises, <em>Shakespeare: Staging the World</em> offers a completely new approach to one of the most creative imaginations in history and opens a window onto a fascinating moment in London's past.</p><p><br><strong>Jonathan Bate </strong>is Provost of Worcester College, Oxford. He was formerly Professor of Shakespeare and Renaissance Literature at the University of Warwick. He is the editor of the highly acclaimed <em>RSC William Shakespeare: Complete Works </em>and the author of many books, including <em>Soul of the Age: A</em> <em>Biography of the Mind of William Shakespeare </em>and <em>English Literature: A Very Short Introduction.</em> He is on the Board of the Royal Shakespeare Company.<br><br><strong>Dora Thornton</strong> is curator of Renaissance collections at the British Museum. She is the author of numerous publications including <em>Objects of Virtue: Art in Renaissance Italy</em> (with Luke Syson) and<em> The Scholar in His Study: Ownership and Experience in Renaissance Italy.</em><br><br>"This richly illuminated - and illuminating - book is a brilliant introduction to the world Shakespeare inhabited, refashioned in his capacious imagination, and bequeathed to us."--Stephen Greenblatt, author of Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare and general editor of The Norton Shakespeare <br><p><br></p></p><h2>Someone Else&#39;s Love Story: A Novel (P.S.)</h2><p><p><em>Someone Else's Love Story</em> is beloved and highly acclaimed <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Joshilyn Jackson's funny, charming, and poignant novel about science and miracles, secrets and truths, faith and forgiveness; about falling in love, and learning that things aren't always what they seem&#x2014;or what we hope they will be.</p><p>Shandi Pierce is juggling finishing college, raising her delightful three-year-old genius son Nathan, aka Natty Bumppo, and keeping the peace between her eternally warring, long-divorced parents. She's got enough complications without getting caught in the middle of a stick-up and falling in love with William Ashe, who willingly steps between the robber and her son.</p><p>Shandi doesn't know that her blond god Thor has his own complications. When he looked down the barrel of that gun he believed it was destiny: It's been one year to the day since a tragic act of physics shattered his world. But William doesn't define destiny the way others do. A brilliant geneticist who believes in facts and numbers, destiny to him is about choice. Now, he and Shandi are about to meet their so-called destinies head on, making choices that will reveal unexpected truths about love, life, and the world they think they know.</p></p><p><p><b>Author One-on-One: Christina Baker Kline and Joshilyn Jackson</b></p> <p><strong>Christina Baker Kline</strong> is a novelist, nonfiction writer, and editor. Her novels include Orphan Train and Bird in Hand. She lives in an old house in Montclair, New Jersey, with her husband, and three boys.</p> <p><strong>Christina Baker Kline: </strong>Your characters seem to have broken the "rule" that men and women can't be friends. Do you think this is possible only in novels?</p> <p><strong>Joshilyn Jackson:</strong> You might be asking the wrong person. When I was nineteen, I met a gangly, dark-haired, geeky guy with big feet and a weird sense of humor. He quickly became my dearest friend. In those days, I would have said, &#x201c;Of course they can!&#x201d;</p> <p>Seven years later? He&#x2019;d grown into the big feet and become one helluva man. Reader, I married him. Twenty years and two kids later, I still like him best. </p> <p>The man/woman thing is powerful, and it can be so sneaky. Attraction can grow between the most unlikely pairings, given time and shared experiences and discovered connections. It doesn&#x2019;t always happen, but it&#x2019;s a risk. Better not to mess around with it if you&#x2019;re sure you do not want it. You can&#x2019;t get sex back to sleep once it&#x2019;s good and woken. </p> <p><i>Someone Else&#x2019;s Love Story</i> has two sets of man/woman best friends, and I didn&#x2019;t want attraction to intrude on the dynamics. I tried several ways to remove it entirely from both equations, but it didn&#x2019;t work until I attacked sex where it is most powerful&#x2014;in its mystery. I took away wondering and speculation; both pairs of friends have already had sex with each other before the novel begins.</p> <p>Men and women can&#x2019;t get around sex, true, but I thought perhaps these two friend-pairs had elected to move through it. Through it, and into something else.</p> <p><strong>CBK: </strong>This is a story about family and friendship, truth and secrets, and love. But it is not necessarily a love story. Do you think that on some level all stories are love stories?</p> <p><strong>JJ:</strong> Yes. Not all stories are romances, certainly, but all good stories are love stories, in one way or another. &#x201c;Only connect,&#x201d; E. M. Forster said, and at these words, a great Amen rises in me.</p> <p><strong>CBK:</strong> Your characters have definite musical tastes&#x2014;The Pixies, early David Bowie, They Might Be Giants. Are you promoting your own favorite bands through Shandi?</p> <p><strong>JJ:</strong> I am a visual arts person, a museum person. I am much more interested in seeing than hearing. I have embarrassingly pedestrian musical tastes; I listen to cheery pop with my eleven year old daughter. I like music that doesn&#x2019;t ask me to pay much attention to it. As I write this, Pandora is playing &#x201c;Jungle Love&#x201d; for me. I am chagrined to report that I just thumbsed it up. </p> <p>All the bands mentioned came from hanging out with my husband, my niece Erin Virginia, and my cool friend Lydia. I know this music because it matters so much to them, and they matter so much to me. I used their bands and songs to say things about the characters---not me. </p> <p><strong>CBK: </strong> Your contemporary novel deals with an ancient concept: the miracle. Do you believe in miracles? </p> <p><strong>JJ:</strong> Absolutely. <i>Someone Else's Love Story</i> is full of huge, overblown miracles. A virgin birth, a holy sacrifice, more than one resurrection. But they are all fake. They are all explained away and undercut. They are dust.</p> <p>The real miracles are smaller. There are at least two in this book, so tiny it is easy to miss them. They are very true and dear and frail and human. They spark and pop for only a moment before they begin to diffuse and spread themselves like mist into the story. They change everything. </p><p>For single mom Shandi Pierce, life is a juggling act.

He presents a shattering indictment of the scientific community from the halls of government to the research centers at major universities and corporations. Documents case after case of influence peddling, doctored research and outright fraud, and reveals how the twin forces of money and status compromise and corrupt the pursuit of scientific truth.</p><p>A compendium of scientific scandal from Bell (Economics/CUNY; You Can Win at Office Politics, 1984, etc.), who, in case after exhaustively detailed case of scientific research, exposes lying, cheating, and stealing. In both academia, with its cutthroat competition and links to corporate interests, and governmental contracting, rife with conflicts of interest, Bell unearths the failure of the scientific establishment to safeguard integrity. He demonstrates the ineffectiveness of the peer-review system at the National Science Foundation (a scientist's funding is cut off by rumors of a CIA link--most probably begun by a rival), and highlights how political patronage is involved in big-science funding (the locating of a $25 million earthquake-research center in Buffalo instead of at Univ. of California). Star Wars was funded against the advice of science advisors, Bell says: While Reagan was told that one component would be in production within three years, the scientist in charge of developing it said, ``The most you could say is that it didn't violate the laws of physics''--and his reports were buried. In medicine and elsewhere, whistle-blowers exposing fraud have had their careers derailed as the scientific establishment closes ranks around the accused. Bell contends that greedy pharmaceutical companies hide and doctor data, resulting in unnecessary deaths; and that Pentagon contractors overcharge and turn in defective weapons. (``At any given moment, roughly 60 of the top 100 Pentagon contractors are under criminal investigation.'') Mostly a dry barrage of facts and figures, but bound to create a stir. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In an alarming expose of the scientific community, City University of New York economics professor Bell charges that all aspects of our welfare, social and military infrastructure are threatened by extensive fraud, secrecy and fierce competition for research funds from government and industry. While whistle-blowers are penalized, he notes, especially for exposing such costly fiascos as the space shuttle and the Hubble telescope, control measures--e.g., replication, peer and journal reviewing--are prone to abuse, as are the grant-awarding procedures of the National Science Foundation, the Pentagon and Congress. Among the author's sometimes over-detailed examples--such as the recent case of scientific data faking which forced Nobel Prize winner David Baltimore to resign the presidency of Rockefeller Institute--Bell also condemns drug companies for gross violation of FDA regulations. The author's very tentative solutions call for excluding peers from investigations, providing increased protection for whistle-blowers and meting out stiffer penalties for offenders. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Principles of Three-Dimensional Design: Objects, Space and Meaning</h2><p><p>/9597E-9, 0-13-095975-8, Luecking, Stephen, Object, Space, and Meaning: Principles of Three Dimensional Design/ <b> </b> This book provides a thorough examination of form and organization concepts, and sets them in artistic, cultural, and theoretical contexts. It covers the traditional principles of an introduction to three-dimensional design, but with a slant that shows them to be viable and effective while linked to more contemporary approaches. This necessitates illustrations taken from highly diverse societies, and a large number of examples drawn form nature and science. <b> </b> Chapter topics include problem solving; forms in space; planes in space; organization; surface and relief; mass and void; line and point; color and material; structure; time and kinetics; notes on meaning; place; and virtual space. <b> </b> For use by community art centers, and other teachers of three-dimensional art. </p></p><p><p> This text is a thorough introduction to three-dimensional design: the importance of forms and objects in space. It covers the areas of problem solving: form/plane/space relationships. Of equal importance is its unique coverage of functional, cultural, and spatial contexts that condition the meanings we impart in creating objects. Its underlying goal is to provide a practical and theoretical understanding of how objects and the spaces they occupy shape the physical and perceptual nature of our reality. </p><p> The disciplines of three-dimensional design are as varied as the objects that share our world. Between the pure expression of sculpture and the rigorous utility of engineering, between the nanotechnologist and the urban planner, are myriad journeys an author could navigate. This text veers toward the expressive principles of the sculptor, but broaches the logistics of the engineer when needed. Its underlying goal is to provide a practical and theoretical understanding of how the objects and the spaces they occupy shape the physical and perceptual nature of our reality. </p> <p> We play out our days in an environment awhirl with objects. Rising in the morning we crawl from between sheets and rise from the bed while listening for the weather on the radio. On a side table may rest the reading glasses, book, and lamp from the night before. We start to don the day's clothing and address the shower, commode, washbasin, faucets, mirror, toothbrush, razor, make-up, and bottles, tubes, and jars of lotions and potions. This is just in the first few minutes of the day! </p> <p> Without these objects we would literally find ourselves naked in the wilderness. There, our first impulse would be to seek clothing, food, and shelter, and to fashion the tools needed to obtain these. We would, of necessity, become three-dimensional designers. </p> <p> Despite&#x2014;or perhaps because of&#x2014;our largely unconscious interaction with an object-ridden environment, objects shape our ideas and perceptions as much as the thoughts that we learn and expound. In his book "Man the Toolmaker," Kenneth Oakley suggests equivalence between objects and ideas in his definition of culture as "the communication of ideas and the manufacture of tools." A particular culture, by this definition, is a unique composite of its ideas and tools and of the systems by which they are propagated. </p> <p> One reason that this definition works is that, often as not, ideas and things are inseparable. Objects arise from ideas and translate these into actuality. Ideas in turn emerge from relationships observed within and between objects. </p> <p> The first chapters of this text look within objects for ideas. Chapters 1 through 9 examine the forms and their interrelationships that constitute objects and how these arrangements of forms aid the expressive and practical roles of the objects. Such elements of form as line, plane, surface, mass, material, and structure are examined in individual chapters. The other three chapters of problem solving, form in space, and organization address more general aspects of the interrelationship of form. In sum, these chapters offer the basis for a beginning course in three-dimensional design. </p> <p> The last four chapters step outside of the objects and look at the nature of objects in time, in their environment, in virtual space, and in the meanings they proffer. All of these have a profound effect on the role and, therefore, the design of objects. These chapters could augment a beginning course or underpin an advanced course in three-dimensional design. </p> <p> The entire text is laced with references and illustrations to a variety of cultural groups. At first this was intended to round out the student's understanding of the principles covered. As the text progressed, it evolved into simply the best way to teach how form and its making intersect with the finest ideas of human thought. By seeking out these images the author personally gained renewed fascination with objects and spaces and the meanings imparted by their makers. </p> <p><b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b></p> <p> The author wishes to thank Jalissa Bauman for her tenacious research style and gracious communication skills, and Margaret Lanterman for her patient expertise on the subject of introducing students to the world of form and its implications. </p> <p> The publisher wishes to thank the following reviewers for their helpful suggestions: </p> <p> Patrick James Shuck of St. Louis Community College, Meramec Campus; Pamela B.

Controversial and influential on its first appearance in 1894, the book opened up a new direction for the English realist tradition. Unflinching in its depiction of the dark and sordid side of Victorian culture, it remains one of the great novels of London life and labor in the 1890s. The novel depicts with extraordinary candor Esther's struggles against prejudice and injustice, and the growth of her character as she determines to protect her son. Her moving story is set against the backdrop of a world of horse racing, betting, and public houses, whose vivid depiction led James Joyce to call <em>Esther Waters</em> "the best novel of modern English life."<br><br>The new introduction by Stephen Regan examines the novel's vivid depiction of Victorian sub-culture, horse-racing and gambling, the London tavern, and the life of working-class women, and he also explores the stylistic influences of French naturalism and Impressionist painting. The new edition includes considerably expanded explanatory notes that provide helpful glosses on unfamiliar expressions and define a range of horse racing and betting terms. In addition, there is an improved chronology and a new bibliography.<br><br><strong>About the Series</strong>: For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

It limits its focus to ten major countries so readers won't be overwhelmed by excessive details. <b> </b> Democratization and globalization. Political issues and changes in developing countries. Alternative institutional frameworks. The effects of socioeconomic cleavages. Non-western cultures and values. Electoral systems. New directions in comparative research. <b> </b>For anyone wanting a readable introduction to comparative politics and a broader understanding of world politics. </p></p><p>The text approaches the study of comparative politics from a topical or thematic viewpoint. Rather than focus on descriptions of individual countries, it addresses the major issues and theories of comparative politics. The emphasis is on comparison as a tool for social science research as a means of understanding broader trends in world politics.<p> Young Americans who visit abroad as tourists or as students are always surprised at how much their counterparts in other parts of the world know about the United States and its government and politics; international youth are amazed at how little we Americans know about their countries and politics. In a world that is shrinking in size as a result of the electronic and communications revolutions and that is increasingly interdependent economically, politically, and socially, knowledge about other countries around our world is essential for contemporary students from all disciplines. Yet American students are among the least well informed about what is going on in other countries. Introductory courses in comparative politics are designed to help overcome that weakness and to provide the basis for a lifetime of learning about the world around us. </p> <p> The introduction to comparative politics is a challenging course for both the student and instructor. The challenges come from the dual nature of the course: to introduce beginning students to the comparative method of analysis and to provide background on politics in several different countries. Both these goals are necessary. Comparison is an important approach to gaining insight into social science, but information about a number of "cases" or countries is necessary in order to draw such comparisons. Students in courses that deal only with a series of country studies, one after another, usually fail to learn to make the comparisons; students in courses that focus more on a thematic approach and comparison tend to end up feeling that they have been hit by a flood of unconnected facts. </p> <p> The task of giving students enough information to engage in comparative analysis without overwhelming them with too many isolated facts about many countries they have barely heard of is a real challenge for those teaching introductory comparative politics. This short textbook is designed to assist in that task by focusing on the challenge of comparison. It can be used with traditional textbooks that deal with several countries in a single volume; it can also provide a comparative framework for instructors who wish to use a series of single-country textbooks. It can be used alone in conjunction with readers on issues in comparative politics or intensive use of international news sources. </p> <p> The book addresses a series of issues and themes in comparative politics by making comparisons from a limited set of countries. I hope to introduce a number of basic features of politics around the world that are important for students to understand as they become interested and informed citizens: the nature of sovereignty, parliamentary systems, proportional representation, political culture, political party systems, and so on. Such information will assist citizens in understanding the nature of their own country's political system and in finding other ways of remedying problems they may find in that system. Another goal is providing introductions to the conceptual and theoretical issues that are likely to be important as preparation for more advanced courses in comparative politics: democratization, economics and politics, military intervention, and so on. Students will thereby acquire the vocabulary and rudimentary theoretical basis for discussing these issues in depth in future course work in comparative politics. </p> <p> In order to limit the flood of facts for introductory students, I have drawn most of the comparisons from a set of ten countries: Britain, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, and Russia. These countries are sufficiently prominent that they appear regularly in our newspapers. They are also the countries that are most often used in introductory courses in comparative politics because of their international stature or the particular political features that they illustrate. The countries offer a range of political experience that allows comparisons of issues such as historical impact on contemporary politics, development, change, legitimacy, democratization, and political performance. </p> <p> I acknowledge first of all my debt to over thirty years of students in courses in comparative politics who have helped me to learn how to make politics abroad interesting and important. Their eagerness to learn about the world and to see how foreign experience can better enable them to understand their own political system is impressive and makes the task of preparing a textbook such as this a daunting challenge. I hope that those who read this book will appreciate how much their predecessors have taught me about comparative politics. </p> <p> I have also benefited from the suggestions and corrections of those who reviewed this text in manuscript form. For the first edition, Harvey Fireside, Arthur B. Gunlicks, Richard L. Merritt, Andrew Milnor, and Thomas Nichols provided useful guidance. For the second edition, I received helpful suggestions from Kathryn Hochstetler, Colorado State University; Alice B. Hashim, University of Louisville; and Rodger M. Govea, Cleveland State University. The staff at Prentice Hall and Barbara Reilly did an outstanding job of production. Above all, I appreciate the love and patient support of my wife, Carol W Wilson, on this and many other projects. I dedicate this volume to her. </p> <p> Frank L.

When the revolutionary French state seeks to unmask him, Percy's estranged, independent wife, Marguerite, unwittingly sets their agent on her husband's track. Percy's escapades, and Marguerite's daring journey to France to save him from the guillotine, keep the reader turning the pages of Baroness Orczy's well-paced romantic adventure. <br><br>Written in just five weeks in 1903, Baroness Emma Orczy's bestseller has been the basis of multiple adaptations. Rooted in the upheaval of Orczy's Hungarian childhood, and in the anxious nationalism of turn-of-the-century Britain, the story of the Scarlet Pimpernel provided a blueprint not only for subsequent historical swashbucklers, but for superheroes from Zorro to Superman. <br><br>This edition places <em>The Scarlet Pimpernel</em> within the context of the elite and popular literature of the turn of the century. Orczy's novel is close in kin to such contemporary political thrillers as Joseph Conrad's <em>The Secret Agent</em> (1907); tales that channeled contemporary concerns about refugees and enemies within.<br></p><p><br><strong>Nicholas Daly</strong> is Professor of Modern English and American Literature at University College Dublin.

Less noted is another critical technology with which women forged new and mobile public lives&#x2015;cycle wear. This illustrated account of women's cycle wear from Goldsmiths Press brings together Victorian engineering and radical feminist invention to supply a missing chapter in the history of feminism.</p><p>Despite its benefits, cycling was a material and ideological minefield for women. Conventional fashions were unworkable, with skirts catching in wheels and tangling in pedals. Yet wearing &#x201c;rational&#x201d; cycle wear could provoke verbal and sometimes physical abuse from those threatened by newly mobile women. Seeking a solution, pioneering women not only imagined, made, and wore radical new forms of cycle wear but also patented their inventive designs. The most remarkable of these were convertible costumes that enabled wearers to transform ordinary clothing into cycle wear.</p><p>Drawing on in-depth archival research and inventive practice, Kat Jungnickel brings to life in rich detail the little-known stories of six inventors of the 1890s. Alice Bygrave, a dressmaker of Brixton, registered four patents for a skirt with a dual pulley system built into its seams. Julia Gill, a court dressmaker of Haverstock Hill, patented a skirt that drew material up the waist using a mechanism of rings or eyelets. Mary and Sarah Pease, sisters from York, patented a skirt that could be quickly converted into a fashionable high-collar cape. Henrietta M�ller, a women's rights activist of Maidenhead, patented a three-part cycling suit with a concealed system of loops and buttons to elevate the skirt. And Mary Ann Ward, a gentlewoman of Bristol, patented the &#x201c;Hyde Park Safety Skirt,&#x201d; which gathered fabric at intervals using a series of side buttons on the skirt. Their unique contributions to cycling's past continue to shape urban life for contemporary mobile women.</p></p><p>Kat Jungnickel is Senior Lecturer in the Sociology Department of Goldsmiths, University of London and the author of<i> Bikes and Bloomers: Victorian Women Inventors and Their Extraordinary Cycle Wear</i> (Goldsmiths Press).<p>This meticulously researched book demonstrates how women hacked their way into cycling culture.

This collection, focusing on the hand, challenges this dichotomy, offering theoretical and empirical perspectives on the interconnectedness and interdependence of the manual and mental. The contributors explore the possibility that the hand, far from being the merely mechanical executor of preconceived mental plans, possesses its own know-how, enabling "enhanded" beings to navigate the natural, social, and cultural world without engaging propositional thought, consciousness, and deliberation.</p><p>The contributors consider not only broad philosophical questions&#x2015;ranging from the nature of embodiment, enaction, and the extended mind to the phenomenology of agency&#x2015;but also such specific issues as touching, grasping, gesturing, sociality, and simulation. They show that the capacities of the hand include perception (on its own and in association with other modalities), action, (extended) cognition, social interaction, and communication. Taken together, their accounts offer a handbook of cutting-edge research exploring the ways that the manual shapes and reshapes the mental and creates conditions for embodied agents to act in the world.</p><p><b>Contributors<br></b>Matteo Baccarini, Andrew J.

Conlin&#39;s lively, literary narrative captures and keeps student interest. This textbook is appropriate for the American History survey course at both two-year and four-year schools. Features: * The basic production values that are a hallmark of the Harcourt Press keep this classic textbook remarkably affordable. * Conlin presents material in fifty-one manageable chapters, assisting student comprehension. * Each chapter contains one of two recurring boxed features, How They Lived or Notable People. New to this edition: * Expanded coverage of Pre-Columbian America highlights a major revision of the early chapters. * Two chapters in early nineteenth century history have been combined to form a new consolidated chapter on the social and cultural history of the Jacksonian period. * Conlin has thoroughly revised and updated chapters addressing recent history, including adding one new chapter. * The fifth edition includes increased coverage of both native American and environmental history integrated throughout the text.</p><p>Joseph Conlin was born in Philadelphia and educated at Villanova University (A.B.) and the University of Wisconsin (M.A., Ph.D.). He taught American history at half a dozen colleges and universities, spending most of his career at California State University, Chico. He was a Fulbright Professor in Rome and Salzburg and was twice Visiting Senior Lecturer at the Social History Centre at Warwick University, England. For 30 years (60 semesters), with a few subtracted for sabbaticals, he taught between one and four sections of the United States history survey course each term, a total of about 200 times. He won four awards for excellence in teaching. Conlin has written a dozen books, about 70 articles in scholarly journals and magazines of popular history, some 100 book reviews in a variety of journals, and more newspaper journalism than he can or cares to remember. Several of his published essays and one book were awarded &#34;best of the year&#34; prizes."I like that the chapters on war are divided into two - conceptually, this helps students break major events into two bits. The Civil War &amp; WWII are divided chronologically, and WWI is divided by foreign &amp; domestic activity which is nice for a short period of American involvement."<br><br>"The opening quotes for each chapter set the tone--a technique I already use to illicit discussion and critical thinking in my classes. Photo captions and sidebars are illuminating and seem to answer the questions students did not realize they needed to ask [e.g. p.464 sidebar on Lady Homesteaders.] They take students into the era rather than keep them as outsiders looking in--a shot of whimsy to lighten the rest of the load."<br><br>"I like the organization and the philosophy as I have stated above. I also like the "bite-sized" chapters and the "How They Lived" and "sidebars" within the chapters. Many students have short attention spans.

Victorian Periodicals Review</p><h2>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</h2><p>Suberbly illustrated by Gustave Dore, this lovely hardcover edition of the classic poem is a wonderful addition to any reader's library. Samuel Taylor Coleridge produced nearly all of his best poetry in a two year period, 1797-1798, including <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i> and <i>Kubla Khan</i>. After writing Ode to Dejection (1802), his farewell to the Muse of Poetry, he wrote few poems and concentrated almost exclusively on literary criticism and political, philosophical, and theological essays.<br><br><i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner </i>relates a nightmarish voyage experienced by a sailor abard a ship beset by supernatural events. The sailor siezes a man who is on his way to a wedding and begins to narrate his epic tale. The wedding guest is at first indignant, but his displeasure soon turns to fascination as he becomes transfixed by the sailor's extraordinary story.<br><br>After inexplicably slaying an albatross that guides his ship to safety during a horrific storm, the Mariner incites the fury of vengeful spirits who inflict terrible suffering on the crew. An errie vessel appears bearing the ghostly spectors of Death and Life-in-Death. Death wins the souls of the shipmates and the Mariner is cursed with Life-in-Death. After days of suffering, the Mariner has an epiphany and sees the spirits as beautiful. While his kinship with nature is restored, he is forced to continue roaming the earth, spreading his message of love for God's Creation. &nbsp;</p><p>Gustave Dore's magnificent engravings for <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i> are among the later works of the great French illustrator. The intensely evocative poem provided Dor� with the long-awaited opportunity to convey limitless space on a gigantic scale, and he exploited the poem's fantastic range of atmosphere to the limits of its possibilities. The terrifying space of the open sea, the storms and whirlpools of an unknown ocean, the vast icy caverns of Antarctica, the hot equatorial sea swarming with monsters, all of the amazing visual elements that make Coleridge's masterpiece one of the most exciting and most memorable poems in the English language are unforgettably engraved in Dor�'s plates.<br>This edition reproduces all of the plates to perfection, in their original size. The illustrations and the text of the poem appear on facing pages, so that the imaginative kinship of Dor� and Coleridge is delightfully evident on every page: the illustrations capture all the moods of the poem in their full intensity, bringing the images evoked by the words into clear visual focus.<br>Unabridged and slightly rearranged republication of the 1878 American edition.

She is the author of <em>We Eat the Mines and the</em> <em>Mines Eat Us</em> (1993). She was awarded the American Anthropologist's Distinguished Service Award in 1995."Drawing perspective from career-long study of worker and peasant activism in the Americas, Nash argues that the Zapatista rebellion has energized new and hopeful efforts combining grass-roots and global activism for justice, rights, and viable livelihoods into pluricultural initiatives attentive to ethnic, class, and gender equity. Mayan Visions is the most useful study to date on this confluence of indigenous, grass roots, and national and global civil society activism in Chiapas."<br>-George A. Collier, Professor of Cultural and Social Anthropology, "Stanford University ** wants to see revisions. <br>"June Nash, one of the living icons of the practice of modern anthropology as both a humanistic and socially committed discipline, offers us in this wonderful new book her own retrospective vision of almost half a century in the intellectual and political history of Maya studies in Chiapas.

Gossen, Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Anthropology and Latin American Studies, "University of Albany, SUNY <br>"An extraordinary book by one of our great anthropologists. June Nash shows us how the Zapatista Movement is one expression of wide ranging social movements in which marginalized people struggle to find their place in the newly emerging global order.

It chronicles the tumultuous history of Castile in the wake of the Christian capture of the Islamic city of Tulaytula, now Toledo, in the eleventh century and traces the development of Castilian culture as it was forged in the new intimacy of Christians with the Muslims and Jews they had overcome.<br> <p><br> The authors paint a portrait of the culture through its arts, architecture, poetry and prose, uniquely combining literary and visual arts. Concentrating on the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the book reveals the extent to which Castilian identity is deeply rooted in the experience of confrontation, interaction, and at times union with Hebrew and Arabic cultures during the first centuries of its creation. Abundantly illustrated, the volume serves as a splendid souvenir of southern Spain; beautifully written, it illuminates a culture deeply enriched by others.</p></p><p><p><b>Jerrilynn D.

Gehrke provides an accessible yet intensive history of the speech communication discipline during the twentieth century. Drawing on several previously unpublished or unexamined sources&#x2014;including essays, conference proceedings, and archival documents&#x2014;Gehrke traces the evolution of communication studies and the dilemmas that often have faced academics in this field. In his examination, Gehrke not only provides fresh perspectives on old models of thinking; he reveals new methods for approaching future studies of ethical and political communication.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gehrke begins his history with the first half of the twentieth century, discussing the development of a social psychology of speech and an ethics based on scientific principles, and showing the importance of democracy to teaching and scholarship at this time. He then investigates the shift toward philosophical&#x2014;especially existential&#x2014;ways of thinking about communication and ethics starting in the 1950s and continuing through the mid-1970s, a period associated with the rise of rhetoric in the discipline. In the chapters covering the last decades of the twentieth century, Gehrke demonstrates how the ethics and politics of communication were directed back onto the practices of scholarship within the discipline, examining the increased use of postmodern and poststructuralist theories, as well as the new trend toward writing original theory, rather than reinterpreting the past. &nbsp;In offering a thorough history of rhetoric studies, Gehrke sets the stage for new questions and arguments, ultimately emphasizing the deeply moral and political implications that by nature embed themselves in the field of communication.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than simply a history of the discipline's major developments, <i>The Ethics and Politics of Speech</i> is an account of the philosophical and moral struggles that have faced communication scholars throughout the last century. As Gehrke explores the themes and movements within rhetoric and speech studies of the past, he also provides a better understanding of the powerful forces behind the forging of the field. In doing so, he reveals history&#x2019;s potential to act as a vehicle for further academic innovation in the future.</p><p><b></b>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Pat J. Gehrke </b>is an associate professor of communication at the University of South Carolina and has served as chair of the communication ethics division of the National Communication Association. He has published articles on communication ethics and other topics in a range of journals, including the <i>Quarterly Journal of Speech</i>,<i> Argumentation and Advocacy</i>,<i> Philosophy and Rhetoric</i>, and <i>Philosophy Today.</i></p><p>"What connection does living well actu�ally have with speaking well? The Roman rhetorician Quintilian defined the orator as a good person speaking well. But because it's unclear that virtue actually <i>does </i>breed eloquence, or eloquence virtue for thatmatter, Quintilian evades what Richard Lanham calls the Q Question: <i>Is the</i><i>good speaker necessarily a good person?'</i>Gehrke locates places in liberal demo�cratic discourse where the Q Question makes incongruous appearances&#x2014;such as the federally sponsored "Four-Minute Men" making congenially propagandisticspeeches to U.S. theatergoers. The connec�tion between supposedly hygienic rhetoric and military action became especially troubling when Allied rhetorical strategies against fascism proved nearly impossibleto distinguish from fascist rhetoric against democracy (hence Gehrke's renaming the Q Question as the Hitler Question).Despite our hopes for speech communica�tion to foster mental hygiene and moral excellence, Gehrke writes, "we always seem deep in examples of rhetorical skill void of such excellence."</p><p>The intractability of the Q Question has made speech communication a discipline both restless and resourceful. After theearly decades of the 20th century, speech teachers shifted emphases from public oratory to group discussion on the grounds that discussion was more balanced, more objective, arid less triumphalist&#x2014;only to bump, once again, into the ethics/efficacy dualism. As it turned out, mental hygiene, not to mention rational group discussions, provided little stay against the coerciveness of mass-mediated messaging. The result was a shift in speech communicationfrom the quasi-scientific approach of the 1920s and 1930s to the existen�tialist philosophy of the 1950s and 1960s. But even while challenging essentialist accounts of speech&#x2014;especially those treating communication as the transfer of mean�ing from self to self&#x2014;existentialism ran into its own variant on the Q Question. For all their ethical sophistica�tion, existentialist-inflected speech theories proved just as preoccupied with efficacy as their essentialist counterparts. The final decades of the 20th century only sharp�ened the irony as philosophical relativists in speech communication behaved more and more like political absolutists.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Gehrke's story makes no claim to be the Authorized Version: "The point is not whether this work is <i>a </i>comprehensive or synoptic account of the history of a field of thought&#x2014; it is not&#x2014;but rather whether it carefully documents the possibility of conceiving of that field of thought or the particular questions within that field in a compelling and viable way." In the final chapter of the book, Gehrke shows how the discipline has deployed aggressively postmodern idioms to wrestle yet again with perennial questions of ethics and politics.</p><p>First, the ethics. If it is true that speech does not come from the self, but rather the self from speech&#x2014;and Gehrke believes the discipline's conversations bear out that contention&#x2014;then such a speaking self must negotiate an "ethics that cannot privi�lege oneself or what is common between oneself and others but must privilege something that comes before anything that might be shared or common." He calls what "comes before anything" the eventof "being-communicating," an ongoing encounter with the Other that is always bringing the self into existence: "However, it is not any specific or particular relation�ship that brings the 'I' into being but rather the sheer fact that there is any relation at all." Accordingly, being-communicating occurs in encounter after encounter in which the Other enlivens and confronts the self with an endless series of ethical choices for which no certain criteria obtain. This ethic has political conse�quences: we should not "seek to achieve an end state or to realize an ideal vision" but rather make "small moves within the gaps and ruptures in existing political sensibilities."<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Compelling and viable the book proves to be, even for those who disagree with Gehrke's immanentist ethical and political sensibilities. Not least, the book suggests that the routinely despised basic speech course belongs in the curriculum. Simply learning how to deliver a speech well, it turns out, confronts us with vital questions about agency arid otherness. Further, Geh�rke's history offers a welcome alternativeto the worn cardiocentric trope, "It's what in your heart that counts." Shifting moral analysis from the heart to the tongue, he weaves ethics as closely to speech as St. James does. Finally, the book serves as a corrective to those whose "just do it" approach to cul�tural engagement collapses ethics into efficacy. Gehrke's small moves" may evokefor some readers what James Davison Hunter calls 'faithful presence.'" --Craig Mattson&nbsp; </p> (Craig Mattson <i>Books &amp; Culture</i> 2012-01-01)</p><h2>The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons, Third Edition</h2><p>From the silent shorts of the 1920s and '30s to the classic Disney features of the '40s, and from the Saturday morning television shows of the '70s and '80s to the computer-generated blockbusters of today, animation remains widely popular with viewers of all ages.

A chief executive officer, quoted in &#39;Is Business Bluffing Ethical?&#39; by Albert Z. Carr INTRODUCTION Recently, there has been exploding interest in the idea of &#39;spirituality&#39; in the workplace. Major business magazines such as Business Week and Fortune have run cover stories on the topic, and academic conferences, corporate programs, and executive retreats have been organized around this theme. Understandably, the concept of integrating one&#39;s faith and values into the workplace is important and rightfully deserves such attention. However, actual attempts to bring faith-based values into the workplace can be challenging and riddled with tension when the &#39;darker&#39; aspects of business and the reality of economic competition are factored into the equation. In fact, some research supports the suspicion that many business people do, in fact, live with two conflicting sets of rules: one for business, and one for their lives outside of work. Some observers of commercial life have gone so far as to claim that virtue and success have an inverse relationship. Unless individual participants leave &#39;private&#39; morality at the door, financial gain will prove elusive. Business demands shrewdness and the bending, if not outright breaking, of rules, the argument typically goes. Play &#39;softly&#39; and you will soon be surpassed. Not that &#39;good&#39; behavior is nonexistent. When it occurs, however, the motivation behind it is self-interest, not ethics per se. Organizations are trapped by similar deterministic rules.A &#39;nice&#39; company that engages in &#39;restrained&#39; competition or sacrifices profits for the benefit of employees or the local community beyond motivational or public relations value will soon find itself in decline if competitors don&#39;t operate with similar rules and intentions. The idea that business demands different standards for behavior is particularly problematic for those who adhere to a belief system that holds that a unified set of values should be applicable to life in its totality. The thought that the very virtues that govern their lives outside of work could be the ones that jeopardize the ability to succeed within it is deeply troubling. Moreover, if the construct is true, we are lead to the inevitable conclusion that all who have achieved success in business from a financial standpoint have somehow compromised their moral standards in the process. In stark contrast to the belief that financial success requires ethical compromise, a popular sentiment has it that good ethics is good business. Behavioral compromises are unnecessary and are the product of short-sightedness. After all, honesty and fairness will only enhance economic well-being. Customers prefer to deal with individuals and organizations with a rock-solid reputation for honesty. Therefore, ethics and self-interest do not clash at all. Sound strategy and prudence require only the short-term sacrifice of gain. The central focus of this chapter is to examine some of the tensions and challenges of bringing Christian ethics to bear on business. Do traditional virtues such as honesty and compassion facilitate the prospect for successful participation in business? Or, conversely, do such characteristics doom a business to fail in the &#39;competitive jungle&#39; of economic affairs? In &#39;Is Business Bluffing Ethical?&#39; Albert Z. Carr takes the posture that two sets of morals, one for business and one for private life, is an inescapable reality. Using the game of poker as an analogy to business, Carr argues that practices such as &#39;bluffing&#39; should be judged by business rules and not by &#39;the ethical principles preached in churches.&#39; He concludes that those who try to apply their private morals at the workplace will likely fail to be successful as business people. Based on qualitative research, authors Amar Bhide and Howard H. Stevenson in their article entitled &#39;Why Be Honest If Honesty Doesn&#39;t Pay?&#39; attempted to find evidence to support the popular notion that good ethics and good business are synonymous. In a somewhat surprising and optimistic conclusion, Bhide and Stevenson find that while the idea that &#39;honesty is the best policy&#39; makes intuitive sense, it is an unsubstantiated claim from a rational, economic standpoint. They point to cases in which breaking one&#39;s word is actually handsomely rewarded or, at the very least, seldom punished. Even so, they argue that the trust necessary for business relationships is alive and well, because for many business people honesty is a matter of conscience and morality rather than strategy. In &#39;Companies Are Discovering the Value of Ethics,&#39; author Norman Bowie contradicts the view that ethics and profits are inversely related. While he does not make the claim that good ethics always lead to higher profit margins, Bowie provides multiple examples in which ethics have had a positive impact on the bottom line. This is the case, he argues, because attention to ethics can provide firms with a source of competitive advantage. The case studies in this chapter provide windows through which one can see some of these tensions and challenges illustrated. &#39;Borland&#39;s Brave Beginning&#39; presents a true-to-life scenario in which truth telling and financial success seem to be in conflict. &#39;Keeping Secrets&#39; divides a manager&#39;s loyalty between an organization and a freindship. READINGS Is Business Bluffing Ethical? Albert Z. Carr Harvard Business Review (January--February 1968). Copyright 1967. The ethics of business are not those of society, but rather those of the poker game. Foreword &#39;When the law as written gives a man a wideopen chance to make a killing, he&#39;d be a fool not to take advantage of it. If he doesn&#39;t, somebody else will,&#39; remarked a friend of the author. Mr. Carr likens such behavior to the bluffing of the poker player who seizes every opportunity to win, as long as it does not involve outright cheating. &#39;No one thinks any the worse of you on that account,&#39; says the author. &#39;And no one would think any the worse of the game of business because its standards of right and wrong differ from the prevailing traditions of morality in our society.&#39; Mr. Carr became interested in this subject when he was a member of a New York firm of consultants to large corporations in many fields.The confidences of many stress-ridden executives made him aware of the extent to which tensions can arise from conflicts between an individual&#39;s ethical sense and the realities of business. He was struck also by the similarity of the special ethical attitude shown by many successful and stress-free businessmen in their work to that of good poker players.

Yet, even after the recent economic crisis, middle-class women are more likely to work than working-class women. Sarah Damaske deflates the myth that financial needs dictate if women work, revealing that financial resources make it easier for women to remain at work and not easier to leave it. Departing from mainstream research, Damaske finds three main employment patterns: steady, pulled back, and interrupted. She discovers that middle-class women are more likely to remain steadily at work and working-class women more likely to experience multiple bouts of unemployment. She argues that the public debate is wrongly centered on need because women respond to pressure to be selfless mothers and emphasize family need as the reason for their work choices. Whether the decision is to stay home or go to work, women from all classes say work decisions are made for their families. In <i>For the Family?,</i> Sarah Damaske at last provides a far more nuanced and richer picture of women, work, and class than the one commonly drawn.<br><b>Winner of the 2011 National Women's Studies Association Sara Whaley Prize for best book on women and labor.</b></p><p>Sarah Damaske is an assistant professor of Labor Studies and Employment Relations and Sociology at the Pennsylvania State University.<br>"This simple, yet powerful explanation for women's work pathways illuminates two clear mechanisms for facilitating women's steady employment: creating and providing access to better jobs and encouraging men to become equal partners in paid and unpaid labor...

Moving beyond facile understandings, Sarah Damaske gives us a much-needed exploration of women across the class and race spectrum, revealing commonalities and differences in their weaving of work and family.

Baird, Assistant Professor of Sociology, Kansas State University <br><p></p><br>"In this pathbreaking book, Sarah Damaske shows us what should have been obvious all along: financial resources actually help women find a good job and establish a stable career, rather than push them out of the workplace. Yet the pressure to be considered a good mother means women of all class backgrounds describe their actions as a matter of family need rather than personal desire. Beautifully written and persuasively argued, <em>For the Family?</em> overturns conventional wisdom and compels us to reconsider what we thought we knew about women and work." --Kathleen Gerson, Professor of Sociology, New York University, and author of <em>The Unfinished Revolution</em> <br><p></p><br>"A major contribution... Damaske draws compelling conclusions about the need for more extensive parental leave and childcare policies. It is this vision that has the greatest potential to inform future federal and state policy... Damaske's <em>For the Family?</em> has a lot to offer future research...

The impossibility of having a principle for philosophy has become a position of principle. As a result, rhetoric has taken over. Content has given way to the priority of form. Michel Meyer's book aims at showing that philosophy as foundational is possible and necessary, and that rhetoric can flourish alongside, but the conception of reason must be changed. Questioning rather than answering must be considered as the guiding principle. </p><p>What the author calls "problematology" is not only the study of questioning but also the analysis of the reasons why it has been repressed throughout the history of philosophy. Since Socrates, philosophers and scientists have reasoned by asking questions and by trying to solve them. Questioning has been the unthematized foundation of philosophy and thought at large. Philosophers, however, have preferred another norm, granting privilege to the answers and thereby repressing the questions into the realm of the preliminary and unessential. They have not considered their discursive practice as being based upon some question-answer (or problem-solution) complex, but exclusively on the results they call propositions. Meyer argues that propositions ensue from corresponding questions, and not the other way around.</p><p>Anthropology, ontology, reasoning, and language thus receive a new interpretation in the problematological conception of philosophy, a conception in which questions and problems are thematized afresh. The theory of language in everyday use, in argumentation, or in literary analysis receives a full and decisive treatment here, making Meyer's question-view one of the leading theories in contemporary thought, alongside his rhetoric for which he is already well known.</p></p><p><p>Michel Meyer is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Mons and the University of Brussels and author of several books, including <em>From Logic to Rhetoric </em>(1986).

But at no point have all the different ethnicities on Earth been reconciled. Animosity, distrust, and hostility among people from various ethnicities have always existed in American history. Even in the church, we have often built walls&#x2015;ethnic segregation, classism, sexism, and theological tribes&#x2015;to divide God&#x2019;s people from each other.<br><br>But it shouldn&#x2019;t be this way. God&#x2019;s people are the only people on earth who have experienced true reconciliation. Who better to enter into the ethnic tensions of our day with the hope of Jesus?<br><br>In <i>Intensional</i>, pastor D. A. Horton steps into the tension to offer vision and practical guidance for Christians longing to embrace our Kingdom ethnicity, combating the hatred in our culture with the hope of Jesus Christ.</p><p><b>Racism Has a Cure</b><br>Issues of race and ethnicity are a source of profound pain and conflict&#x2015;and the church is right in the middle of the problem. But it&#x2019;s not supposed to be this way. The people of God are the only humans who have experienced true reconciliation. Who better to enter the ethnic tensions of our day with hope?<br><br>With thoughtful courage and practical guidance, pastor D. A. Horton casts a vision for living our Kingdom ethnicity&#x2015;God&#x2019;s people as one multicultural, multiethnic, multigenerational people.<br><br>Following Jesus holistically means holding in tension our unique ethnic heritages while being part of a new humanity.

He and his best friend, Elicia, have been married for fifteen years and have three children.God has lovingly but firmly compelled me to labor for &#x201c;ethnic conciliation,&#x201d; D. A. Horton&#x2019;s preferred terminology, as opposed to &#x201c;racial reconciliation&#x201d;&#x2015;&#x201c;ethnic&#x201d; because our construct of race is biblically unsound and practically harmful, and &#x201c;conciliation&#x201d; because &#x201c;reconciliation&#x201d; assumes we were previously living in unity. This pursuit has sometimes left me feeling like Horton, &#x201c;flirting with the belief that hate [has] won.&#x201d; But Horton brings the esperanza (hope) of the gospel into everyday experiences. His life experiences and biblical scholarship deliver practical and eternal guidance.

Horton, who has provided redemptive language that enables us to engage across the ethnic divide in a way that glorifies God and honors our fellow image bearers. His is a needed prophetic voice for such a time as this. (Bryan Loritts, lead pastor at Abundant Life, author of Insider Outsider)<br><br>In a world where things are often black and white&#x2015;even in the church&#x2015;it&#x2019;s so refreshing to hear yet another voice, a powerful one, that can add to the greats of our time, saying things others avoid, yet with love. To use D. A.&#x2019;s own words, &#x201c;The complexion of America is browning both socially and spiritually.&#x201d; As a Latino, I&#x2019;m so grateful for this voice, perspective, and transparency to the church from his heart! #EnHoraBuena (Rudy Rubio, pastor at Reformed Church LA)<br><br>D. A.

Horton is the rare Christian leader whose superior intelligence and eloquence are matched and even exceeded by his exemplary Christian character.

Even&#x2015;and especially&#x2015;for the reader who might disagree with certain aspects of Horton&#x2019;s treatment of this controversial topic, <i>Intensional</i> offers much food for thought. Highly recommended. (Bruce Riley Ashford, author of Letters to an American Christian)<br><br>D. A. Horton is well positioned to address the issue of ethnic conciliation and the reduced gospel that has enabled churches to perpetuate ethnic divisions throughout the North American church. D.

In <i>Intensional</i>, D. A. Horton has given us an incredible work that will help Christians move forward with compassion, humility, and true repentance regarding those longtime ethnic tensions. This is a timely, much-needed book that I cannot recommend highly enough. (Matt Carter, pastor of preaching at Austin Stone Community Church)<br><br>When I was an assimilated soldier in the army, I only saw green&#x2015;and Jesus was green, too, since that&#x2019;s where I thought I met him. When I transitioned out of the army and into full-time ministry, I thought Jesus didn&#x2019;t see our colors, just our hearts. Jesus then began to begin to chip away at me and brought me to the reality of my own heart.<br><br><i>Intensional</i> is a powerfully written perspective for the reader who <i>chooses</i> to consider and engage in the conversation about ethnicity and the people of God. D. A. Horton goes into the depths of where the issues are: in the heart. This is a great resource for those who are really willing to look and engage. I&#x2019;ll be chewing on this for a bit; this book has been a breath of fresh air as I&#x2019;ve been trying to figure out how to engage and implement these ideas in my ministry.

And yet, despite how frequently his ideas are evoked, there remains a surprising amount we don&#x2019;t know about the father of modern evolutionary thinking, his intellectual roots, and the science he produced. <i>Debating Darwin</i> seeks to change that, bringing together two leading Darwin scholars&#x2014;Robert J. Richards and Michael Ruse&#x2014;to engage in a spirited and insightful dialogue, offering their interpretations of Darwin and their critiques of each other&#x2019;s thinking.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Examining key disagreements about Darwin that continue to confound even committed Darwinists, Richards and Ruse offer divergent views on the origins and nature of Darwin and his ideas. Ruse argues that Darwin was quintessentially British and that the roots of his thought can be traced back to the eighteenth century, particularly to the Industrial Revolution and thinkers such as Adam Smith and Thomas Robert Malthus. Ruse argues that when these influences are appreciated, we can see how Darwin&#x2019;s work in biology is an extension of their theories. In contrast, Richards presents Darwin as a more cosmopolitan, self-educated man, influenced as much by French and particularly German thinkers.&nbsp; Above all, argues Richards, it was Alexander von Humboldt who both inspired Darwin and gave him the conceptual tools that he needed to find and formulate his evolutionary hypotheses. Together, the authors show how the reverberations of the contrasting views on Darwin&#x2019;s influences can be felt in theories about the nature of natural selection, the role of metaphor in science, and the place of God in Darwin&#x2019;s thought.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revealing how much there still is to investigate and interrogate about Darwin&#x2019;s ideas, <i>Debating Darwin</i> contributes to our understanding of evolution itself. The book concludes with a jointly authored chapter that brings this debate into the present, focusing on human evolution, consciousness, religion, and morality. This will be powerful, essential reading for anyone seeking a comprehensive understanding of modern-day evolutionary science and philosophy.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Robert J. Richards</b> is the Morris Fishbein Distinguished Service Professor in History of Science at the University of Chicago, where he is professor in the departments of history, philosophy, and psychology and in the Committee on Conceptual and Historical Studies of Science and directs the Fishbein Center for the History of Science and Medicine. His books include, most recently, <i>Was Hitler a Darwinian? Disputed Questions in the History of Evolutionary Theory</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press. <b>Michael Ruse</b> is director of the Program in the History and Philosophy of Science at Florida State University.&nbsp; His books include <i>The Gaia Hypothesis: Science on a Pagan Planet</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;This work is devoted to an exchange between two friendly adversaries, Richards and Ruse. Both authors have previously debated Darwinian evolution, but this book allows Richards and Ruse to expand their ideas and rebut each other&#x2019;s contrasting views. Ruse explains that Darwin had a &#x201c;mechanistic&#x201d; view of the world and was the product of 18th-century Britain, including the Scottish Enlightenment. Richards indicates Darwin was more &#x2018;cosmopolitan,&#x2019; was influenced by other thinkers (particularly Alexander von Humboldt), and was deeply impacted by German romanticism. Thus, Darwin&#x2019;s evolutionary model was &#x2018;teleological&#x2019;&#x2014;Darwin accepted <i>final cause</i>. Ruse strongly differs with Richard&#x2019;s analysis&#x2014;most biologists and historians would reject it as well. The book includes an epilogue summarizing the important developments in evolutionary biology that took place after Darwin. This book will have special appeal to historians and philosophers of biology. Recommended.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;[T]his book gives an airing to an important debate that has simmered for years and is now displayed so that a wider audience can appreciate its significance. Read it, and make your own mind up.&#x201d; (<i>British Journal for the History of Science</i>)<br><br>"In most volumes with more than a single author, the contributors complement each other, addressing a common subject matter from a shared point of view. Robert J. Richards and Michael Ruse's <i>Debating Darwin</i> is unusual in the sense that its two authors disagree, profoundly so, about their joint topic of interest--Charles Darwin. . . . This format succeeds admirably well. Both Richards and Ruse are top-bracket historians and philosophers of science, and both have long been at the cutting edge of Darwin scholarship. While reading one author's persuasive account, one can't wait to read what the other could possibly have up his scholarly sleeve to outclass his opponent; and reading on, one equally eagerly anticipates the respective responses. . . .&nbsp;I strongly recommend this book to anyone who teaches evolutionary biology, as either a history course or a science course. We have been given an accessible, quality read in the form of an exciting and skilled joust between two knights in the service of today&#x2019;s king of evolution theory." (<i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This engaging dialogue between Richards and Ruse is both an excellent, accessible summary of two distinguished scholarly careers of research on Darwin and evolution and a source of fresh insights.&nbsp; Although the authors situate Darwin&#x2019;s life and thought in two very different cultural contexts&#x2014;German romanticism (Richards) and English gentlemanly society (Ruse)&#x2014;the reader is struck more by how compatible and instructive these accounts are for understanding Darwin&#x2019;s thought as a rich and fertile source of subsequent inspiration and debate.&nbsp; A highly recommended introduction to the topic for students and general readers and an entertaining read for veterans of the Darwin wars.&#x201d; (David Sepkoski, author of Rereading the Fossil Record: The Growth of Paleobiology as an Evolutionary Discipline)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Debating Darwin</i> offers readers a ringside seat at a friendly but no-holds-barred fight about Charles Darwin&#x2019;s place in history.&nbsp; Was the British Enlightenment the making of Darwin, as Ruse contends?&nbsp; Or was Darwin a child of the Romantic science of Goethe and his followers, as Richards suggests?&nbsp; Watching these two outstanding scholar-teachers argue it out is an education in history, science, and the pleasures of serious disagreement.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp; (Gregory Radick, author of The Simian Tongue: The Long Debate about Animal Language)<br><br>&#x201c;Charles Darwin&#x2019;s ideas were controversial from the outset, so much so that Darwin&#x2019;s friend and supporter Thomas Henry Huxley said he sharpened up his claws and beak in order to defend them. Here in this volume the debate continues as two world-renowned historians explore what Darwin&#x2019;s proposals meant in his own day and to us now. The issue at stake is how best to understand Darwin as a thinker&#x2014;was he influenced primarily by his personal social context, the industrializing entrepreneurial world of Britain in the Victorian era, or was he more in touch with the great intellectual currents flourishing in continental Europe?&nbsp; How did these questions influence his religious sensibilities and those of his readers? Back and forth, the ripostes sparkle with intellectual energy. Through Ruse&#x2019;s and Richards&#x2019; eyes, we can see Darwin afresh, as the enthralling historical figure who not only transformed biology but also our deepest sense of who we are.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (Janet Browne, author of Charles Darwin: The Power of Place)<br><br>"The authors&#x2019; debate is learned, witty, engaging, and even passionate. Students and Darwin scholars&nbsp;alike will be able to read this volume with interest&nbsp; and&nbsp; enjoyment&nbsp; and&nbsp; be inspired&nbsp; to go back&nbsp;to Darwin&#x2019;s own writings, especially to Darwin&#x2019;s early notebooks, the <i>Origin of Species</i>, and the <i>Descent of Ma</i>n in the continued e?ort to comprehend Darwin in his historical context."<br> (<i>Journal of the History of Biology</i>)<br><br>"I learned a great deal reading the complicated and intellectually demanding <i>Debating Darwin</i>, over and over, more times than I can count during the eight months the book has been in my hands.

It was a noisy, hot, scary place. Choking gas exploded from volcanoes and oceans of lava bubbled around the globe... Then in the deep, dark ocean, something amazing happened. This is an exciting and dramatic story about how life began and developed on Planet Earth, written especially for younger children.&nbsp; The authors explain how the first living cell was created, and how the cells multiply and create jellyfish and worms, and then fish with bendy necks, which drag themselves out of the water into swampy forests. They tell the story of the biggest creatures that have ever walked on land &#x2013; the dinosaurs. Long after that, hairy creatures who have babies, not eggs, take over, stand on two legs and spread around the world, some of them living through cataclysmic events such as ice ages and volcanic eruptions. Everyone living today is related to these survivors. With delightful illustrations including lots of detail and humour, all carefully researched and checked, this book shows the development of life on Earth in a truly accessible and simple way. &nbsp; CLICK HERE &nbsp; to download Teachers' Notes specially written by the authors,&nbsp; Catherine&nbsp; Barr&nbsp; and Steve Williams, to assist teachers and librarians in the promotion and teaching of&nbsp; The Story of Life in schools and to help foster a love of good books, literature and reading in children.</p><p>CATHERINE BARR studied Ecology at Leeds University and trained as a journalist.

Confidential (BFI Film Classics)</h2><p>Manohla Dargis explores the careers of director Curtis Hanson and writer James Ellroy, based on interviews with both men, to dig deep into the film&#39;s obsession with the twinned, equally troubled histories of the Hollywood studio system and the city of Los Angeles.</p><p>L.A. Confidential was released in 1997 to huge critical acclaim and it went on to be nominated for nine Academy Awards. Its reputation has since grown to the point that the film is now widely seen as a key Hollywood movie of the 1990s. But it fared poorly at the box-office, having neither big-name stars nor the sop of a comforting moral universe. With characters so bad they were irresistible, the film harked back to an older, darker Hollywood at a time when audiences would soon be flocking to &#34;Titanic&#34;. Directed by Curtis Hanson from the best-selling novel by James Ellroy, &#34;L.A. Confidential&#34; stars Kim Basinger alongside Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito and, to the surprise of many industry watchers, two then relative unknowns, New Zealander Russell Crowe and Australian Guy Pearce. The film is a consummate thriller which takes in - without once losing sight of the human cost - police corruption, organized crime, the sleaze press, high-class prostitution, murder and the ways movies and life twist together. Manohla Dargis explores the careers of Hanson and Ellroy, based on interviews with both men, to dig deep into the film&#39;s obsession with the twinned, equally troubled histories of the Hollywood studio system and the city of Los Angeles. She untangles the paradox of &#34;L.A. Confidential&#34;, a film that paints a jet black, melancholy picture of a city and an industry even as it also testifies to - and exemplifies beautifully - their seductive glamour.Manohla Dargis is a film critic for The L.A.

John Hardman describes the career of this ruthless political manipulator, and in the process explores the dynamics of the French revolutionary movement and the ferocious and self-destructive rivalries of its leadership.This original book gets behind the polished but chilly surface of the public persona to reveal how Robespierre came by his extraordinary power and how he used it.</p><p><p> Get under the surface of the most powerful and feared leader of the French Revolution </p><p><br>* Offers brilliantly original analysis. <br>* Explains how Robespieree came by his extraordinary power. <br>* Explores the power and development of a police state. <br> A provincial lawyer from Arras, Robespierre (1758-94) dominated France at the height of the Revolution, the event which more than any other, shaped modern history. Robespierre had an enigmatic and contradictory personality, reclusive, cerebral and austere, yet at the same time both neurotic and theatrical with a solitary lifestyle, hidden away even at the height of his fame in modest lodgings with a family he trusted. Others have written extensively by concentrating on analyzing Robespierre's set-piece speeches to parliament and the Jacobian club, but John Hardman gets behind the polished but chilly surface of the public persona by examining Robespierre at his desk rather that at the rostrum. Concentrating on Robespierre's administration rather than his rhetoric, Robespierre offers not only a brilliant original analysis of its formidable protagonist, but also a dramatic vantage point from which to survey the main phase of the Revolution itself, from the fall of the ancien regeime to the end of the Terror. As a title in the very popular Profiles in Power series, this is not a biography, though inevitably it contains much biographical material, it instead analyzes the major features, achievements and failures of Robespierre's career. </p><p> John Hardman formerely of the University of Edinburgh has written Louis XVI (Yale 1993) and French Politics (Longman 1995).</p><p> <b>John Hardman</b> formerely of the University of Edinburgh has written <i> Louis XVI</i> (Yale 1993) and <i> French Politics</i> (Longman 1995).</p></p><h2>The Epistles of John and Jude (Ironside Commentaries)</h2><p>Devotional, practical, and Christ-centered, the Ironside Expository Commentary series offers insightful and practical comments that bring out the essential truths of God&#39;s Word.

Thoreau</h2><p><p><b>Thoreau's major essays annotated and introduced by one of our most vital intellectuals.</b></p><p>With <i>The Essays of Henry D. Thoreau</i>, Lewis Hyde gathers thirteen of Thoreau's finest short prose works and, for the first time in 150 years, presents them fully annotated and arranged in the order of their composition. This definitive edition includes Thoreau's most famous essays, "Civil Disobedience" and "Walking," along with lesser-known masterpieces such as "Wild Apples," "The Last Days of John Brown," and an account of his 1846 journey into the Maine wilderness to climb Mount Katahdin, an essay that ends on a unique note of sublimity and terror.</p><p>Hyde diverges from the long-standing and dubious editorial custom of separating Thoreau's politics from his interest in nature, a division that has always obscured the ways in which the two are constantly entwined. "Natural History of Massachusetts" begins not with fish and birds but with a dismissal of the political world, and "Slavery in Massachusetts" ends with a meditation on the water lilies blooming on the Concord River.</p><p>Thoreau's ideal reader was expected to be well versed in Greek and Latin, poetry and travel narrative, and politically engaged in current affairs. Hyde's detailed annotations clarify many of Thoreau's references and re-create the contemporary context wherein the nation's westward expansion was bringing to a head the racial tensions that would result in the Civil War.</p></p><p><p><b>Lewis Hyde</b> is the author of <i>Trickster Makes This World: Mischief, Myth, and Art, The Gift: Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property</i>, and a book of poems, <i>This Error Is the Sign of Love</i>. He is Thomas Professor of Creative Writing at Kenyon College.</p><p>&#x201c;Hyde's volume is a well-chosen, handsome collection of essays with a splendid introduction. Everyone will want to use it--it's a real contribution.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Robert D. Richardson, author of Henry Thoreau: A Life of the Mind</i></p><p>&#x201c;This thoughtfully-edited gathering of Thoreau's essays will surely be of great interest both to Thoreauvians and to readers approaching his work for the first time.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Lawrence Buell, Harvard University, author of The Environmental Imagination: Thoreau, Nature Writing, and the Formation of American Culture</i></p><p>&#x201c;[This book is] much enhanced by Hyde's intelligent and entertaining introduction. He has collected thirteen of Thoreau's essays but has chosen to depart from the customary practice of separating 'nature' essays from 'political' essays, instead arranging them in the order of their composition. In so doing, Hyde reminds us that the two worlds were indivisible even in the mind of Thoreau. To separate what we call 'human nature' from what we call 'the natural world' has always been the work of sophistry, never a reflection of the truth.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Newark Star Ledger</i></p><p>&#x201c;The first fully annotated edition of Thoreau's major essays, here presented in the order Thoreau wrote them: 'Natural History of Massachusetts,' 'A Winter Walk,' 'Paradise (To Be) Regained,' 'Ktaadn,' 'Civil Disobedience,' 'Walking,' 'Slavery in Massachusetts,' 'Life without Principle,' 'Autumnal Tints,' 'The Succession of Forest Trees,' 'A Plea for Captain John Brown,' 'The Last Days of John Brown,' and 'Wild Apples.' Includes 'A Note on the Selection' of the essays, a bibliography, thirteen illustrations, a map to accompany 'Ktaadn,' and a detailed index. After the excellent, often fascinating annotations, which are presented in the back of the volume (the essays appear in clear-text form), the most valuable component of the volume is Hyde's insightful forty-three-page introduction, titled 'Prophetic Excursions.' By far the most useful, most informative single collection of Thoreau's short prose we have had.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Bradley Dean, The Thoreau Society Bulletin</i></p></p><h2>The Beginning Translator&#39;s Workbook: Or the ABC of French to English Translation</h2><p>This workbook combines methodology and practice for use in a course for beginning translators with a proficiency in French ranging from intermediate to advanced level. It takes a linguistic approach to the problems of translation in addressing common and major pitfalls: delineation of &#39;translation units&#39; or what constitutes a concept beyond mere words, word polysemy, false cognates, structural and cultural obstacles to literal translation. It offers chapter by chapter explanations of the various strategies used by professional translators to counter these problems: the translation devices known as transposition, modulation, equivalence, and adaptation. Each chapter concludes with a variety of practice exercises focusing on one specific problem. The second part of the book is a global application of all the principles taught in the first part and guides the student step by step through the actual translation of a choice of literary (prose, poetry, and plays) and non-literary excerpts.</p><p>Michele H.

In the House and the Senate, and from committee room to the floor, the fundamentals of lawmaking are made clear in Walter Oleszek's straight talking, informative book on Congress. With dozens of lively illustrations, charts, and extracts from real documents, Oleszek spotlights both "regular order" and unconventional procedures while explaining the role of congressional leadership, the use of strategic tactics, and complicated parliamentary processes. Readers will appreciate Oleszek's insight on the ever-sophisticated use of procedures--such as "filling the tree"--to achieve party and policy objectives in a time of sharper partisanship. <p>Updates include: </p><ul><li>changes in congressional budgeting, such as the return of fiscal deficits, the clash between discretionary spending and entitlements, and the drive to curb the explosion in earmarks</li> <li>the "nuclear option" controversy over filibusters </li> <li>the wider use of technology in the lawmaking process</li></ul></p><p><b>Walter J. Oleszek</b> is a senior specialist in the legislative process at the Congressional Research Service. He has served as either a full-time professional staff aide or consultant to every major House and Senate congressional reorganization effort beginning with the passage of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970. In 1993, he served as Policy Director of the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress. A long-time adjunct faculty member at The American University, Oleszek is a frequent lecturer before various academic, governmental and business groups. He is the author or co-author of several books, including <i>Congress and Its Members,</i> 10th ed. (2006),with Roger H. Davidson, and <i>Congress Under Fire: Reform Politics and the Republican Majority</i> (1997), with C. Lawrence Evans.The new edition of Walter Oleszek's <i>Congressional Procedures and the Policy Process</i> continues to be the preeminent and most comprehensive work on the rules, procedures, and decision making of Congress. No other work comes close to this book in its objective and original scholarship, clarity and usefulness to Members of Congress, the media, scholars, students, and the general public. Oleszek has written a treasure. It is the primary source of authoritative knowledge about the complexity of the rules of the congressional policy process. I have adopted every edition of this book for my students and I will continue to do so. --- James A. Thurber, Distinguished University Professor; Director, Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies, American University<br><br>I have used Oleszek's book about congressional procedures as the central text in my undergraduate courses about Congress for many years. It provides a superb introduction to the practical nuts and bolts of lawmaking, emphasizing not just the content of congressional rules and precedent, but also how procedure is used strategically by members to accomplish their goals. The book is impressively up-to-date and has lots of great anecdotes. The chapter on the budget process is still the best short introduction to the topic currently in print. Overall, by the end of the course, my undergraduate students are really glad that they have mastered the book. Especially for students who take post-graduate positions relevant to the legislative process in Congress, they often comment years later that reading the Oleszek book during their student days helped them in their professional life after graduation. --- C. Lawrence Evans, Newton Family Professor of Government, College of William and Mary<br><br>Walter Oleszek's <i>Congressional Procedures and the Policy Process</i> provides clear, precise explanations of congressional rules along with timely examples that illustrate how procedures affect what happens in Congress. This book is both an essential text for courses on Congress and an indispensable reference volume for scholars and practitioners. --- Randall Strahan, Emory University</p><h2>Barbarism and Religion, Vol. 2: Narratives of Civil Government</h2><p>The second volume of Barbarism and Religion explores the historiography of Enlightenment, and looks at Gibbon&#39;s intellectual relationship with writers sucah as Giannone, Voltaire, Hume, Robertson, Ferguson and Adam Smith. Edward Gibbon&#39;s intellectual trajectory is both similar but at points crucially distinct from the dominant Latin &#34;Enlightened narrative&#34; these thinkers developed. The interaction of philosophy, erudition and narrative is central to enlightened historiography, and John Pocock again shows how the Decline and Fall is both akin to but distinct from the historiographical context within which Gibbon wrote his great work.</p><p>'Pocock manages to place Gibbon within these larger cosmopolitan movements without diminishing the historian's extraordinary accomplishment.'

Together they form the interconnected network that is Silicon Valley. Apple products are famously &#x201c;Designed in California,&#x201d; but, as Barry Katz shows in this first-ever, extensively illustrated history, the role of design in Silicon Valley began decades before Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak dreamed up Apple in a garage.</p><p>Offering a thoroughly original view of the subject, Katz tells how design helped transform Silicon Valley into the most powerful engine of innovation in the world. From Hewlett-Packard and Ampex in the 1950s to Google and Facebook today, design has provided the bridge between research and development, art and engineering, technical performance and human behavior. Katz traces the origins of all of the leading consultancies&#x2015;including IDEO, frog, and Lunar&#x2015;and shows the process by which some of the world's most influential companies came to place design at the center of their business strategies. At the same time, universities, foundations, and even governments have learned to apply &#x201c;design thinking&#x201d; to their missions. Drawing on unprecedented access to a vast array of primary sources and interviews with nearly every influential design leader&#x2015;including Douglas Engelbart, Steve Jobs, and Don Norman&#x2015;Katz reveals design to be the missing link in Silicon Valley's ecosystem of innovation.</p></p><p>Barry M.
